"""Finding the actual file to play for a scheduled item.

Plex reports each file's path as Plex's own container sees it (for example
/data/media/TV/Show/S01E01.mkv). tapiOca usually sees the same files
under a different path (its media folder, /media by default). Rather than
make you configure the translation, tapiOca works it out: it looks for
the tail of Plex's path inside its media folder, and once it finds a file
it remembers the mapping and uses it for everything else.
