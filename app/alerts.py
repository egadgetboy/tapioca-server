"""Admin alerts: what tapiOca finds wrong that an Admin can act on, each
said once when it starts and again when it's fixed: in the Logs tab, in the
page's header (for Admins), to tapiOca's apps (GET /api/internal/alerts,
for Admins), and to the web addresses an Admin chose (see notify.py).

Only what tapiOca can tell for sure, and only once it has held a while,
so a moment's hiccup is never an alert; and once one starts, it's fixed
only once things have been right a while too, so none comes and goes:

  plex        Plex can't be reached (or won't take tapiOca's token): 5
              checks in a row, a minute apart. Fixed after 2 that reach it.
  plex-pictures  (1.43.0, the owner, DL283) Plex answering 401 for a
              picture for the apps, at once. Fixed after 5 pictures it makes
              in a row, each asked after the latest 401.
  data-full   The data folder's disk has less than 2 GB free: 3 checks in
              a row. Fixed once it has 3 GB free, twice. (A size, never a
              share: 2% of a large pool is still hundreds of GB.)
  data-write  Writing to the data folder fails: 2 checks in a row. Fixed
              after 2 that write.
  station     A station fails to start 3 times within 10 minutes: its stream
              engine failing, nothing on it playing for a program's time, or
              its stream for the apps not starting. Fixed when it plays a
              program again (a minute of it, or to its end), or it's
              deleted.
  backups     A backup (the nightly one, or one made from the page) failed
              twice in a row. Fixed when one is made.
  clock       tapiOca's clock is more than 2 minutes from Plex's, by the
              Date header Plex answers with: 3 checks in a row. Fixed under a
              minute, twice. It's the only reference tapiOca has without
              asking anything else: with no Date from Plex (or no Plex),
              the clock isn't checked.
  outside     tapiOca's apps can't reach it from outside: the outside
              check's own Down (see reach.py: two checks in a row, a minute
              apart, found a problem that counts). Fixed when it's Up again,
              or watching away from home is turned off.
  files       Something on the Broken files tab needs an Admin (see
              reports.py): a person's report, a file a station or Media
              plays that tapiOca found broken or damaged and that isn't
              being replaced by itself, or one Sonarr or Radarr couldn't
              replace. It says how many, and the newest. Fixed when nothing
              does. Said at most once an hour: once an hour has gone by
              since it was last said, anything new since then (still
              there) has it end, unsaid, and start again with a new ID (the
              apps notify once for each ID; the web address is told the
              same); until then, it only says what it is now.
  access      How tapiOca is reached (1.36.0): a door left open that
              something came through in the last day (doors.py: the home
              port reached from the internet, a proxy sending the internet
              to it, an internet name asked for on it, forwarding headers
              from a device that isn't a trusted proxy), each its own
              (`about`), fixed a day after the last; signing in off, once
              setup has asked; trusted networks off while relays hide every
              device (relays.py); an Admin's PIN locked by wrong tries
              (fixed once it's unlocked, 15 minutes on). Never an address.
  clips       Stations someone with limits can see skip commercials or
              trailers that aren't rated (see cliprules.py): it says how
              many stations. Fixed when none does (their folders rated, or
              no one with limits can see them).

Each has an ID that stays the same while it lasts (a new one starting
later has a new ID), its kind, a sentence an Admin can act on, when it
started, and when it was fixed. The alerts now, and those fixed in the last
day, are kept in the database as they change (never at every check), so
when tapiOca starts again they're as they were: one still going isn't
said again, and keeps its ID; it's fixed (and said to be, once) when its
check finds it right again, by that check's own rules, and until a check
can tell (Plex's first, or a station playing again), it stays as it was.
What's checked over again counts afresh: Plex's 5 checks, a station's 3
failures. (If the database can't be written to, they go on as they are,
and the log says so: a restart then may say them again.)
