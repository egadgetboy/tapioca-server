"""Checking files for problems before anyone plays them: the stations'
programs, and what's shared for Media in tapiOca's apps (the libraries
an Admin shared with them). One record per file, whoever plays it (see
broken.version_key): a file checked for a station isn't checked again for
Media, or the other way around, unless it changes.

One queue, at the lowest priority, and none of it while anyone's watching,
a station or Media (a lower disk priority isn't honoured by ZFS and most
NAS disks: fewer reads is what keeps the streams' own reads quick). In
this order:

  1. A station's program airing soon (in an update that hasn't started
     yet, or on within SOON_S) that's due a check.
  2. A file someone just had trouble with (see Target): a copy of it that
     failed to be made or stopped, a problem an app sent as it happened, or
     a person's report. The stretch of it where that happened is decoded as
     the deep scan decodes, then it gets the quick check (and for a report
     that says where, the deep scan, if those find nothing). Only what
     tapiOca finds puts it on the list: trouble that was the network's
     or the app's changes nothing about the file.
  3. Arrival check: a program new to a station (or whose file changed),
     then what's newly added to a library shared for Media, gets a quick
     check within minutes. The file must open, and picture and sound must
     decode at five points: the start, a quarter, halfway, three quarters
     and the end.
  4. Weekly sweep: every program on a station gets the quick check again
     once a week, in case a file went missing or a share changed. (Media's
     files are checked when they arrive, and when someone has trouble with
     one.)
  5. Overnight deep scan: in a window you choose (1-6 AM unless you change
     it), files are decoded in full, picture and sound, timed the way
     tapiOca plays them: the stations' programs first, whatever airs
     soonest first; then Media's: what's in someone's Continue Watching,
     the next episode of a show someone is watching, then the rest by most
     recently added (each with its quick check first, if it hasn't had
     one). It stops the moment anyone starts watching and carries on where
     it left off later. A file is deep-scanned once, and again only if it
     changes.

What counts is what stops a program airing whole and as it should. What
tapiOca plays through without anyone minding (a pause, a file a few
seconds short of its length, a decoder's complaint about nothing seen or
heard) doesn't.

  * Broken: the file won't open, has no picture, nothing decodes somewhere
    in it, its picture stops before the end (it's cut short), or it can't
    be read (a disk error).
  * Damaged: it plays, but not properly:
      - the picture breaks up (a picture ffmpeg couldn't decode, or had to
        patch up and that stays on screen), the sound drops out
        (SOUND_HEARD_S or more of it lost at one spot), or it skips (part of
        the file garbled), anywhere but its first two seconds and its last
        five;
      - no sound (or no picture and no sound) for GAP_S or more partway:
        not a silence before the sound starts or after it ends, in the end
        credits, or before a closing logo;
      - no sound track, or sound that's silent all the way through (in a
        program from 1930 on); or a picture black all the way through;
      - sound that stops before the picture does, unless nothing's lost
        (it stops during the end credits, over a black picture, or after
        fading out in the last minute);
      - it plays on well past the length it gives, so its end never airs.
    A picture held still while the sound plays on is fine: some files hold
    one frame a long time (an anime's end credits over one drawing, say).

Both go on the broken-files list, so they're off the air until the file is
replaced or you choose Retry (which also means "put it back on the air": a
file is never deep-scanned twice). In Media, a damaged file still plays; a
broken one doesn't (another version of it plays, if there's one that isn't
on the list).
