"""Stations as HLS, for tapiOca's own apps (and AirPlay and Chromecast).

A station's HLS comes from the very stream everyone else watching it gets:
tapiOca watches it as one more viewer, and ffmpeg cuts it into short
pieces as it arrives (copying them, not converting, so it costs almost
nothing). Every safeguard that keeps a station on the air applies as it is.

It runs only while an app is asking for it. Players ask for the playlist
every few seconds; once nothing has asked for IDLE_S, it stops, and so does
the station (after its usual grace) if no one else is watching. An app that
tunes away says so (leave), and if no other app is watching, it stops then,
rather than holding a tuner until it notices. All the apps
watching one station share one HLS stream, so a station takes one tuner
however it's watched.

The pieces are files in a folder of their own under the system's temporary
folder, deleted as they fall out of the playlist and when the stream stops.

Each app watching counts as a viewing of its own in the stats, for whoever
it's watching for (see playing.Watcher): from when it first asked for the
playlist until it left, or last asked before it stopped asking for IDLE_S.
(The stream itself, one viewer of the station however many apps watch it,
doesn't count.)

Night mode, for apps that can't change the sound themselves (Apple's player,
a Roku): a second HLS stream of the same station, made only while an app
asks for it, with the picture copied as it is and only the sound made over:
rumble under 50 Hz cut, loud scenes brought down the most, and nothing turned
up (NIGHT_SOUND, the same as the Android app does it on the device). It watches the
station as one more viewer too, so it needs no tuner of its own; everyone
else keeps the usual sound. Making sound costs little.
