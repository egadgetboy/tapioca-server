"""Turning a station's content into a schedule that runs forever.

The schedule is pure arithmetic from fixed starting points, so what is on at
any moment (and the whole guide) can be computed without keeping any state.
That is what keeps the guide Plex downloaded in step with what actually
plays, even across restarts.

A station's schedule is a series of eras. Each era is a frozen playlist that
takes over from the one before at a program break; a new era is how new
episodes join a station (and removed ones leave) without disturbing
anything already in a guide. An era carries on where the last one left off:
episode order resumes with the program that was due next, and shuffle
finishes the pass it was in (with the new programs added) before starting
fresh passes.

Programs play back to back at their real lengths: nothing is padded or cut
to fit 15/30/60-minute slots, so a 7-minute cartoon is followed straight
away by the next one.

Episode order: one episode from each show in turn, each show in episode
order, like classic reruns. The whole run repeats when it reaches the end.

Shuffle: each pass through the station's library is shuffled afresh, so a
show doesn't come back at the same time of day, and no show plays more than
twice in a row (including where one pass hands over to the next), unless a
station is made up almost entirely of one show and there's no other way.
