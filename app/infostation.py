"""The INFO station (1.34.1, the owner): station 99, on every new tapiOca.

Plex's Live TV & DVR won't take a tuner whose guide has no stations, and a
new tapiOca had none until someone made one: so setup couldn't get tapiOca
into Plex. A new tapiOca now starts with station 99, INFO, with tapiOca's
mark as its logo, playing a film made for it (pearls flying through the
ring of tapiOca's logo, to a light tune; tools/info makes it, and it's in
the image, so it plays without Plex). Over it, as it plays (see
ffmpeg.info_text): the time and date, and a panel that changes every 15
seconds, each in turn:

  * What's new in tapiOca: this version's highlights (assets/info/news.json,
    written with each release). Never the server's state, such as a newer
    version being out: that's for Admins, on the page;
  * tapiOca's apps, in beta: their newest versions, and what's new in them
    (bundled with each release, in assets/info/apps.json);
  * By the numbers: stations (INFO aside), and the movies, shows and
    episodes in the Media folders shared with tapiOca's apps, and how many
    were added this week (counts only, never titles: everyone sees INFO,
    whatever their Viewing Level, in Plex too);
  * A tip for tapiOca's apps, a new one each hour.

Nothing on it costs an outside request: it's what tapiOca knows already,
and Plex's counts, asked once an hour. The pearls fly over all of it (the
film's second video stream is where they are in front: see
ffmpeg.info_pearls).

INFO is always station 99 (the owner): it can be renamed, and its settings
changed, but not renumbered, and no other station can be 99. A tapiOca
whose station 99 is another one gets INFO only once that one moves. It's made once, on a new
tapiOca's first start; deleted, it stays deleted until an Admin brings it
back (Add the INFO station, on the Setup tab). An update never adds
it by itself. What it plays comes from no library: its one source is
{"type": "info"}, and its one program has the key KEY, which the library
answers for itself (see library.py).

Setup counts stations without it: a tapiOca with only INFO is still new.
