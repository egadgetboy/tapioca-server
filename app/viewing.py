"""What each user can see: Viewing Levels, and stations allowed or blocked
for someone (see docs/users.md).

Every user has a Viewing Level (Unrestricted unless an Admin chooses
another): the oldest age their movies and their TV may be rated for,
whether unrated titles are shown, and which libraries they can see.
Unrestricted, with no limits, comes with tapiOca and stays as it is;
so do Teen, Kid and Young Child, to start from, which an Admin can rename,
change or remove like the levels they add. Admins see everything, as does
everyone while signing in is off.

A title is judged by its rating, library and (from 1.33.0) what it is
(titles.Judged), in this order (docs/users.md, "The rules, in order"): a
title hidden for the person hides it; one allowed for them shows it, unless
its library isn't on their level; a library the level doesn't include hides
it; a rating above the level's age for its kind does (unrated: as the level
says); then a genre, tag, collection or studio the level or the person
hides, or the title itself hidden by the level (Blocks). A level or person
that hides by tags hides what's not known yet, as with ratings.

A station is one stream that everyone watching shares, so it's all or
nothing: allowed or blocked for someone by an Admin, or else seen only if
everything it plays passes their level. What it plays is its lineup from
the era airing now on, and the programs its specials draw on; what each
needs is worked out once (a Reach) and kept until the lineup or a rating
changes.
