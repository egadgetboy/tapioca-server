"""Linked devices, and the "Who's tuning in?" picker on them (see
docs/users.md).

A device is one of tapiOca's apps on a TV, phone or tablet. It's linked
once, by someone signing in on it (with their password, or a code entered on
tapiOca's page), and keeps a long-lived key, kept here only as a hash; an
Admin can unlink it on the Access tab, which signs it out at once. Whoever
is using it picks themselves from its picker, and gets a sign-in on that
device that lasts a day from when it was last used (picking again starts a
new one, and ends whoever was signed in there before).

Who's on a device's picker: from 1.38.0 (the owner, October 17), only
those who signed in on it themselves, never because of their Show on or an
Admin's choice of devices (kept as they were, for going back to 1.37.1,
but listing no one: see on_picker). The picker always has Sign in, by name:
the first time on a device with an invite code (made by an Admin, once, for
7 days), a password, or a link code entered on tapiOca's page, never just a
PIN; after that, they're on that device's picker. Anyone can take
themselves off a device's picker.

A PIN (4 digits, kept as a hash) is asked for when someone picks
themselves, if they have one; an Admin without one gives their password on
a device others use too. An Admin's PIN gives their Admin tools only in
Light sign-in, at home, on a device they signed in on with their password;
otherwise it's for watching (see choose). Five wrong PINs for someone means
a 15-minute wait for them, on every device. Someone with neither a password
nor a PIN (a "Kids" user, say) gets on a device with an invite code, and is
on it only at home, where anyone there may pick them: no one can get in
from anywhere by guessing a name.
