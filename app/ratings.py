"""Content ratings, read as the youngest age each suits (see docs/users.md).

Plex writes a rating as the agent gave it: "PG-13" or "TV-14" for the US,
and for other countries usually with the country first, "gb/15", "de/12",
"au/MA15+". Each is read here as an age, so a Viewing Level's limit (an age)
can be compared with any of them. What can't be read (blank, "NR", "Not
Rated", a code not known here) is unrated: None.
