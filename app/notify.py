"""Alert notifications: tapiOca posts to up to 3 web addresses when an
Admin alert starts and when it's fixed (see alerts.py), for ntfy, Gotify,
Home Assistant, Discord, Slack and the like. An Admin's setting, off to
start, on the Logs tab: one switch for them all, and a format for each.

The addresses are the Admin's own: tapiOca sends only this there, and
contacts nothing else on its own. Each is http or https only. For each one,
tapiOca waits 5 seconds for an answer, tries once more when there's no
good one, follows no redirect, and keeps nothing of the answer but its
status (for the page's "Last sent", kept only for an address that's saved:
a test of one typed but not saved keeps nothing). Sending never holds
anything else up: each message goes to every address, in the background,
and each address gets its messages one at a time, in a line of its own, by
the address, so one that fails (or is slow) never holds up or changes the
others, even as the list changes. The addresses are shown to Admins only,
and never written to the logs whole (they can carry a token): only their
hosts are.

An alert counts as told (see alerts.py's untold) once any address takes it,
so an address that's down never has the others told it again after a
restart; it's untold when none takes it.

Four formats: plain text (the message, with a Title header, as ntfy takes
it); JSON, for Gotify, Home Assistant and others: {"title": "tapiOca",
"message": "...", "kind": "...", "state": "started" or "fixed"}; Discord's
own: {"username": "tapiOca", "content": "...", "allowed_mentions":
{"parse": []}, "flags": 4} (the message with what Discord's markdown reads,
such as ** or a link, written as text, so a station's name shows as it is;
cut to Discord's 2000 characters; never pinging anyone; and no link
previews, flag 4); and Slack's: {"text": "..."} (with &, < and > written the
way Slack asks, so it never pings anyone either), which Mattermost and
Rocket.Chat take too. A Discord webhook's address always gets Discord's
format, and one on hooks.slack.com Slack's, whichever was chosen: they
refuse the others (400 Bad Request).

Kept as before 1.34.0, so an older tapiOca still notifies the first
address: META ({"on", "url", "format"}: the switch and the first address)
and LAST_META (how the first address's last message went). The others are
kept apart: META_MORE ([{"url", "format"}]) and LAST_MORE ({url: how its
last message went}). (An older tapiOca sends a first address set to
Slack plain text.)
