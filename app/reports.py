"""People's reports of problems in what they watch (from 1.30.0): picked
from a list in tapiOca's apps, never typed, about an episode or a movie
(from its page, or the player's menu) or what's on a station now (from the
station's player). tapiOca knows who sent each one, and on what device,
from the app's sign-in.

The choices come from here (GET /api/internal/report-choices), so they can
change without an app update. What a report does depends on what it says:

  * What tapiOca can check (no picture, the picture breaking up, no
    sound, the sound cutting out, stopping before the end, not playing):
    its file is checked at once, at the front of the queue (see
    scanner.Target): around where it happened first, then the quick check,
    then the deep scan if those find nothing and the report said where.
    Found: the file goes on the list, and is replaced as an Admin has that
    set. Not found: the report waits on the Broken files tab, saying
    tapiOca found nothing wrong, for an Admin to dismiss.
  * What a machine can't judge (the sound out of sync, the wrong language,
    the wrong episode or movie, poor picture quality, subtitles):
    tapiOca says what it can tell beside it (the file's sound
    languages, its length against the show's other episodes', its
    picture's size, its subtitles), and it waits for an Admin: Replace
    (Sonarr or Radarr, blocklisting its release, as for a broken file), Find
    a better copy (an upgrade search, keeping the file), or Dismiss. Only an
    Admin's choice replaces anything.
  * Wrong title, details or artwork: for an Admin to fix where the library
    keeps them (for Plex, in Plex), then dismiss.

A report never takes anything off the air, or out of Media, by itself.
Several reports on one program are one row on the tab, each under it. One
report a day per person per program, and ten a day per person, at most; an
Admin can turn reporting off for someone (Can report problems, on the Access
tab). Kept while they're waiting, and 90 days after they're dealt with (the
newest 5,000 at most).
