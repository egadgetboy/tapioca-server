"""How much tapiOca's apps take on at once, so the server stays steady:
the limits an Admin sets (devices watching at once, and of those, how many
away from home), the connection tests the apps run, and what tapiOca
recommends from those tests.

Each device watching through tapiOca's apps (or another player using
the HLS addresses) gets its own copy of the station's stream: at home over
the home network, and away from home over the home internet connection's
upload. However many watch, a station still takes just one tuner (see
playback.py, whose speed test covers the CPU or GPU), so these limits are
about the network. Plex, Jellyfin and other apps aren't counted here: they
have limits of their own, and the tuners cover them.

The server can't measure its own internet upload without a speed-test
service somewhere else, and tapiOca depends on no outside service. So
the apps measure it, the way viewers use it: an app times data sent to it
by tapiOca (GET /api/internal/speed-test) and says what it found. From away
from home, that's the upload as a viewer away from home gets it.

A device already watching may always change station (it's still one
device); the limits only turn away one more. 0 is no limit.
