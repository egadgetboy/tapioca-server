"""Replacing broken files with Sonarr and Radarr: optional, and off unless
it's set up on the Broken files tab. tapiOca itself only ever needs
Plex; this asks the apps you already use to fetch a better file.

Each time the broken-files list is gone through (see jobs.py), for each
file on it that's broken or damaged (not unsupported), whether a station
plays it, Media in tapiOca's apps does, or both, of the kind they're to
replace (what(): broken or damaged files, missing ones, or both), that
you've said to replace (when(): when you say so, with Replace on the list,
unless you've chosen Automatically, when you can say Leave this one to me
instead), found in Sonarr (an episode) or Radarr (a movie) as exactly one
show and episode, or movie, there, and only while the app is monitoring it
(Sonarr: the show and the episode, as its own searches go by; Radarr: the
movie), so what you've unmonitored, or removed on purpose, is left alone.
For a file that's one of a program's versions, only when the app's file is
that one:

  * A broken or damaged file: the release it came from is blocklisted
    first (its grab marked as failed, as History's "Mark as Failed" does),
    so the app won't download that file again; only then is the file
    removed (into the app's recycle bin, if it has one), and the app asked
    to search for another. Only if the app's file is the very one found
    broken (the same name and size), and only if the app has a record of
    downloading it: a file added by hand can't be blocklisted, so it's left
    for you, saying so.
  * A missing file (removed from Plex while a station has it, or not
    found): the app looks at what's on disk first, then searches for it.

An episode or movie gets at most three searches (TRIES), 8 hours apart
unless the last one brought a new file, so three in about a day; when
they're spent with nothing to show for it, it stays on the list, saying
so, and nothing more is tried until you choose Try again. While the app is
downloading, nothing else is done. When it has the new file, Plex is asked
to look in that folder; tapiOca checks the new file like any new one,
and the program comes off the list and is back on the air if it passes
(jobs.py). If it doesn't, its release is blocklisted in turn; unless it has
the same problem at the same places as the file it replaced (see
same_problem): then it may be how the program was made (an old film's
effects, say), not a bad file, so nothing more is tried, and it's left for
you to look at. Retry puts it back on the air; Try another has the app look
for another.
