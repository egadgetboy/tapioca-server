"""Viewing statistics for the Stats tab: how much each station is watched,
by whom, and what's played on demand; and who's watching now.

Each time someone stops watching a station, the viewing is kept (when it
started and ended), with what aired meanwhile: the seconds of each show or
movie, by day. Viewings shorter than MIN_VIEW_S (flicking past a station)
aren't kept.

tapiOca sees what Plex asks it for, not who's watching in Plex: several
people watching a station together in Plex (or Plex recording it) may be
one viewing. Who's watching comes from Plex itself (WhoWatches): while a
station has viewers, Plex is asked every POLL_S what it's playing to whom,
and each Live TV session is matched to the one station airing what it
shows (watching.py); the time counts for that Plex user, station, and show
or movie. A session that can't be told apart (two stations airing the same
thing at once) counts for no one, and watching through other apps isn't
seen. The same look stops what's kept from some Plex users (limits.py).

tapiOca's own apps are counted one by one: each app watching a station
is a viewing of its own (see hls.py), and counts for the person signed in
on it (see playing.py), so who watched is known exactly. What's played on
demand (Media) counts in its own place: its plays and time, by show or
movie and by person, as it's watched (see ondemand.PlaySessions).
