"""Copies of a program that tapiOca makes for a device that can't play
its file as it is (see docs/on-demand.md): **repackaged**, the picture kept
as it is in a new package, the sound converted where the device needs it;
or **converted**, the picture made into H.264 too (smaller, ordinary rather
than HDR, or with subtitles drawn in). An episode's sound is also made again
for even sound across a show's episodes, and night mode's for an app that
can't make it (see sound_chain).

A copy is HLS: a playlist listing the whole program from its start, in
pieces of about PIECE_S seconds, so the player shows its whole length and
seeks anywhere. The pieces are made as they're asked for, by one ffmpeg at a
time, from where the player is; a jump far ahead or back starts it again
there. ffmpeg writes one MPEG-TS stream, and tapiOca cuts it into the
pieces itself, at the keyframes the playlist says each piece starts on: a
repackaged picture's own keyframes (read from the file's index: see
keyframes.py), or for a converted one, keyframes made every PIECE_S seconds.
Every piece has the program's own times in it, so pieces made by different
runs line up.

A converted picture is encoded where the stations' is: on the GPU while
GpuManager has one in use (see gpu.py), otherwise on the CPU. If a run fails
on the GPU, the copy carries on from there on the CPU and stays there; that
isn't counted against the copy (see FAILURES_MOST), and GpuManager is told.
Copies have strikes of their own there (gpu.COPY_STRIKES_LIMIT), so a
copy's trouble on the GPU never takes it from the stations. A copy also
moves to the CPU, with nothing counted, once the GPU is turned off.

Pieces are made a little ahead of the player and no further (ffmpeg simply
waits until they're wanted), kept a little behind it, and the rest deleted;
all are deleted when the copy stops. A copy stops when its play session
ends, and its ffmpeg stops when nothing has asked for a piece in IDLE_S
(it starts again where the player is, if it comes back).
