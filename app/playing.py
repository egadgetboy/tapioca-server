"""What's playing, and for whom, in words: how the Logs tab names stations,
files and the way they play, and who's watching through tapiOca's apps.

A station is named by its number and name, "station 2, Cartoon Classics"
(or its number alone, when its name says no more). A file's picture and
sound are said as a box would label them: "1080p H.264, 5.1 E-AC-3".

Who's watching through tapiOca's apps: a player can't sign in, so at
home a station's HLS is asked for by an address alone. It's put down to the
person whose app at that address last asked for the stations, signed in,
which is how an app starts watching one (see appapi.py). Away from home, a
stream's own address says whose it is (see away.py). Without signing in,
no one is known.
