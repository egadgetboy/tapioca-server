"""SQLite storage for stations, their eras and frozen playlists.

A station's schedule is a series of eras, each a playlist frozen when it
was made, taking over from the one before at a program break. An era never
changes once saved, so the schedule (and the guide Plex has downloaded)
never shifts on its own; updates only ever add a new era that starts after
what the guide already shows.
