"""The permanent list of files that failed to play, or failed a check.

Stored as a readable JSON file in the data folder so it doubles as a to-do
list. A program on the list is never attempted again; its slots are filled
by a replacement instead. Deleting an entry (in the web page, or by editing
the file) puts the program back into rotation.

One entry per file, whoever plays it: a station, or Media in tapiOca's
apps. A file is known by its program's key, for the file a station plays
(its library's first version of it), and by its key and the version's ID
for any other version of it (see version_key): the same file is the same
entry for the stations and for Media. Entries for other versions are kept
in a list of their own ("versions"), so a release before 1.30.0, which
reads only "files" and knows a program by its key alone, never takes one
for the program a station plays (after rolling back, say).
