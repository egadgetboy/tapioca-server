"""Problems tapiOca's apps run into, sent by the apps themselves as they
happen (not a person's report, which says what the app did lately: see
appapi.py): a station that didn't start or stopped playing, something from
Media that didn't play or stopped, playing that couldn't keep up, the
app closing unexpectedly, and (from 1.29.1) the app not reaching tapiOca
for a minute or more.

Each one says which app, which version, and what kind of device (its model
and system), so an Admin can tell from the Logs tab whether a problem is one
device's, one kind of device's, or everyone's. The same problem from the
same device soon after counts on the same row, and each one is said once in
tapiOca's log, as a warning, naming the station as the log does (see
playing.station). Kept 30 days, the newest 5,000 at most.

From 1.29.1 an app says when each happened (`at`): it keeps those it
couldn't send (tapiOca out of reach, say) and sends them once it's back.
Rows go by when each happened, so the oldest go first when there are too
many: a device sending a backlog can't push out what's newer. Each may come
with the app's last lines before it (its journal), kept with the newest
JOURNALS_KEPT; and the Logs tab says what the error codes the apps send
mean, in plain words (MEANINGS).

What an app says about playing that couldn't keep up ("kept-up") is also
why it went to a smaller version, and what it says about something from
Media that didn't play is why it asked for a converted copy, which the log
says as it does (see applibrary.py): kept a little while for that, in memory
only.
