"""Signing in to tapiOca's page, which is optional.

A new tapiOca is open: anyone who can reach its page can use it. Adding
the first user in the Access tab turns signing in on, and that first user is
always an Admin. There are two roles:

  Admin  Everything: every station, Setup (and backups), Broken files,
         Logs, Stats, and Access (who can sign in).
  User   Stations: watching their guides, making new ones (as many as an
         Admin lets them: 3 to start with), and changing or deleting only the
         stations they made. Adding logos (their own, or from Plex) and Intro
         Bumper videos (Admins delete them). Stats.

What Plex, Jellyfin and other apps use (the tuner, its guide and streams, pictures for
the guide) stays open on the network, as they can't sign in.

Passwords are kept as scrypt hashes, and a browser is signed in by a random
token in a cookie that's kept only as a hash, until no one has used it for
an hour (see IDLE_SIGN_OUT_S). tapiOca's apps sign in the same way, send
their token in a header instead (Authorization: Bearer; see appapi.py), and
stay signed in. Signing in is logged (who and from where) in the access
log, which the Logs tab shows.

Scripts and other apps use tapiOca's API (/api/v1, see api.py) with an
API token an Admin makes on the Access tab: a Viewer token reads; an Admin
token does what an Admin may there too. A token works only under /api/v1,
and from the internet only once an Admin allows that. It's kept as a hash,
shown once, and can be revoked; removing the Admin who made it removes it.

Locked out? Create an empty file called reset-access in the data folder and
restart tapiOca: every user is removed, and it's open again.

Whether a request may go ahead is decided as it arrives, and again once its
body has (which may take a while), so a request can't start while it's
allowed and finish after it no longer is. Changes coming from another site's
page (a browser says which site a request is from) are refused, signed in or
not.

From the internet (through a Cloudflare Tunnel, or another reverse proxy),
tapiOca is reached on its public port (PUBLIC_PORT), never the one Plex
uses. There, what Plex, Jellyfin and other apps use isn't offered at all, signing in is
always needed (until there's a user, nothing but the sign-in page is shown:
the first user is added on the home network), a program played on demand is
offered only at the address of one a signed-in app started there (see
play_outside), each visitor's address is the one the reverse proxy or
Cloudflare passes on (see address), and wrong passwords from the internet
as a whole are limited too (but not on a browser you've signed in on
before, so strangers' wrong passwords can't keep you out).
