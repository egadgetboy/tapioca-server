"""Whether tapiOca's apps can reach it from outside your home, at the
address set for watching away from home (see away.py). The Access tab, the
setup and the page's header show it, and an Admin alert says when it's down
(see alerts.py): Reach.status says what it is, in a sentence, and since
when.

While watching away from home is on, tapiOca asks for itself at that
address, as an app away from home would: GET <address>/api/internal/reach,
with a random value it waits a minute for at most, the certificate checked,
no redirect followed, and 10 seconds at most. That address is open on both
ports, to anyone (see access.py). For a value a check is waiting for, it
answers that it's tapiOca, which port the request came in on, and
whether it came over HTTPS (as the reverse proxy says), and tapiOca
notes that; for anything else, it's 404. So a check knows it reached this
tapiOca, and how, not just that something answered.

It checks a few seconds after tapiOca starts, at once when the setting
is saved, every 5 minutes, and when an Admin chooses Check now. A check
finds one thing (a Finding): Ready (an https:// address reached the public
port over HTTPS, with sign-in on; an http:// one, a VPN's or the home
network's, reached tapiOca), or what's wrong: the reverse proxy points
at the home port, which never asks for a password; not over HTTPS; sign-in
is off; the name isn't found; the certificate; no HTTPS there; the proxy's
own error (it couldn't reach tapiOca); something else answering; a
redirect. Or it couldn't connect (or look up the name just then).

Some of those are problems wherever the check comes from: tapiOca's
own answer saying what's wrong, the proxy's error, a name that isn't found,
a certificate for this very name that has expired (or isn't valid yet, or
was revoked), and an https:// address on tapiOca's own port. The rest
may be the home's router: many don't let devices at home use the home's own
internet address (NAT loopback) and answer it themselves, with their own
sign-in page, certificate or redirect, or not at all, while apps away from
home still work. Those count only once a check from here has reached
tapiOca (since it started), which shows the router lets it through. A
DNS override in the router, pointing the name at the reverse proxy's
address at home, lets tapiOca check from here.

The apps have their say too: tapiOca notes when a signed-in app last
came in through the public port (access.py; main.py, for a station played
there). From both, one status:

  off         Watching away from home is off.
  checking    No result yet, or a problem found once and not yet confirmed.
  up          The latest check was Ready; or it found what may be the router
              (or couldn't look up the name), but an app came in through the
              public port in the last 15 minutes.
  down        Two checks in a row, at least a minute apart, found a problem
              that counts.
  cant-check  It found what may be the router (or couldn't look up the
              name), no check from here has reached tapiOca yet, and no
              app has come in lately: it can't tell from here.

One problem alone never makes it down: tapiOca checks again a minute
later. A line is logged when it goes down (with why) and when it's back,
and once when it can't check from here: never one for each check.

Media in the apps plays through the same address (see applibrary.py), so
Ready covers it too, with nothing more to check: the apps ask for it, and
their players for its programs, as they do for stations (through the same
proxy to the public port, over HTTPS, signed in, a program's own address
letting its player in). Ready says so while a library is shared.
