"""The rating, library and tags of what's on each station, and of what
Media shows people with limits (see docs/users.md).

Whether a user sees a station depends on everything it plays, so the rating
and library of each show and movie on a station is kept here (the `titles`
table, mirrored in memory). They're noted whenever a station's programs are
gathered from Plex (Updater.gather): a movie's rating comes with it, as does
an episode's own, when it has one. A show's rating comes only by asking Plex
about the show itself, and so do a show's or movie's tags (from 1.33.0: all
its genres, its labels, the collections it's in and its studio, whole, which
lists don't give); that's done soon after (`fill`), in batches, and again
every week in case Plex's changed (every day for tags, while someone is
limited by them, and at once when what's hidden changes). Media asks for the
tags of what it shows someone a level or a person limits by them, as it goes
(`ensure`): 50 titles at a time, each batch kept as it comes, a couple of
batches at once, waiting only a few seconds before answering (the rest stay
hidden until Plex has said, a moment later).

What isn't known yet counts as not allowed: a station with a show whose
rating hasn't been asked for is hidden from anyone with a limit until it is,
and one whose tags haven't been from anyone limited by tags.
