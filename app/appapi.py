"""tapiOca's API (/api/v1: the server, its stations and their guide,
documented in docs/api.md, with an OpenAPI spec; see api.py for the rest of
it), and what tapiOca's own apps ask besides (/api/internal: signing in
and connection tests, documented for the apps alone in
docs/internal-api.md). tests/test_app_api.py checks both documents against
the server.

It's a thin layer over what the server already does (stations, their
schedules, signing in, HLS): nothing here plays or schedules anything.
Version 1 only grows; a change that would break a client becomes version 2,
served beside it.
