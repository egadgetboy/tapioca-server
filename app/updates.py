"""Keeping stations up to date with Plex without contradicting a guide.

When Plex gains episodes for a show on a station, or loses some, or a new
movie matches a station's filter, or Plex finds a program's intro or credits
on a station that skips them, the station should follow. But Plex keeps
its own copy of the guide, downloaded about once a day, and changing what
airs during the stretch that copy covers would make it wrong.

So an update never changes anything already in a guide. Every hour
tapiOca asks Plex whether anything changed (skipping the work when no
library has changed) and gets the updated station ready. It then takes over
at the next program break after a moment when no guide could disagree:

  * when Plex downloads the guide, the update is applied just before the
    guide is generated, starting at a break a minute or more later, so the
    guide Plex receives already shows it. tapiOca asks Plex to reload
    its guide when it has an update ready, so this usually happens within
    the hour;
  * if Plex hasn't downloaded the guide for over a day (Live TV not set up,
    or Plex down), the update starts after the end of the last guide handed
    out to anyone.

Changes you make yourself (editing a station, Update now, Reshuffle) take
effect at the next break at least a minute away; tapiOca then asks Plex
to reload its guide straight away.

An update that would take away more than half of a station's programs is
held until you apply it yourself: that's more likely a Plex hiccup (a
library mid-rescan, a drive offline) than something you meant.
