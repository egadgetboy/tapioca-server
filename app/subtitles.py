"""Subtitles drawn into the picture ("burned in"), as each station chooses:
off, forced only (just the lines meant to be read, such as a film's
foreign-language dialogue), or always (in the language set for audio,
AUDIO_LANGUAGE).

They come from the program's own file (text subtitles such as SRT and ASS,
or the picture subtitles of DVDs and Blu-rays) or from a subtitle file next
to it, named as Plex expects ("Film (1999).en.srt", "Film (1999).en.forced.srt").
Viewers can't turn burned-in subtitles off: the station decides. If they
can't be drawn, the program plays without them (see the broadcaster).

Text subtitles inside a program's file are read out into a small file of
their own first (Extraction), kept in the data folder: drawing them straight
from the program's file would mean reading the whole file before its first
picture. That's done in the background, a program ahead; until it's done,
the program plays without them.
