"""Signing in an app with a code, for TVs (and anything else without a
handy keyboard): no password typed on a remote, or sent by the TV.

The app asks for a code and shows it (with where to enter it: the page's
/link). Someone signed in on tapiOca's page enters the code, sees which
app on which device it is, and links it to their account. The app, which has
been checking every few seconds with a secret only it holds (`poll`), then
gets its own sign-in, as if that person had signed in on it.

Codes are 8 letters and digits (no 0, O, 1 or I), last LINK_S, work once,
and can be guessed at only from a signed-in account, WRONG_CODES times in
TRIES_WINDOW_S. Nothing about them is kept on disk.
