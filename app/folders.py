"""Folder libraries: shows and movies from folders of your own, with or
without Plex (1.35.0; see docs/library.md, Phase 3). An Admin adds one on
the Setup tab, under Your own folders: a name, Shows or Movies, and
one or more folders in the media folder. It's shared for Media and used
for stations exactly as a Plex library is: the library layer (library.py)
sends each call about a folder key here.

Keys: libraries are "f1", "f2"...; shows, episodes, movies and collections
"f" followed by digits too (their ids, from 1: "f0" is the INFO station's),
never used twice, and kept across rescans: a file moved or renamed keeps
its key when it's recognizably the same (the same size and the same show,
season and episode, or the same movie).

Scanning walks the folders at the lowest priority, never while anyone is
watching: soon after tapiOca starts, every 6 hours, when an Admin asks, and
when Sonarr or Radarr brings a replacement tapiOca asked for (scan_folder).
Only what's new or
changed (by size and time) is read again. A folder that's gone (an
unmounted share) never empties a library: its programs are kept, and said
to be missing until it's back.

Each detail comes from the first layer that has it: the NFO files beside
the videos, the tags inside the files, then the folders' and files' names
(folderscan.py says how they're read). The online sources, matching and
Needs a match come later. A title tapiOca can't be sure of is listed by
what its names say.
