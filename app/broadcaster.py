"""The per-station streaming engine.

One broadcaster runs per station while anyone is watching it. It walks the
station's schedule, starting one ffmpeg process per program (or, with its
intro and credits skipped, one per part of it that airs), and stitches their
output into a single continuous MPEG-TS stream that every viewer of that
station shares.

Safeguards, in the order they apply:
  * Programs on the broken list are never attempted; their slot goes to a
    replacement.
  * Each file is probed before playing. A file that won't open is marked
    broken and replaced immediately.
  * A program that stops partway (the process dies, stalls, or the file
    ends early) is resumed from where it stopped, twice, after a brief
    pause: a hiccup on the share or in Plex often clears by itself. If it
    still won't play it's marked broken, and the rest of its slot goes to a
    replacement that joins at the same offset, so it ends when the slot
    does and the guide stays right.
  * A commercial or trailer that won't play is left out from then on, and
    the Station ID card covers its time. The program before it is never
    blamed, and nothing is resumed: a break simply carries on.
  * If nothing can fill a slot, a plain card covers only the time left.
    If that happens two slots running, the card says the station is off
    the air, and it's logged as an error.
  * If the engine itself hits an unexpected error, it restarts while viewers
    are still connected, carrying on the same stream timeline. If it keeps
    failing, the station shows the off-air card for a while, then tries
    again.
