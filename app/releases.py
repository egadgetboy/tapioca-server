"""tapiOca's own new versions: every 4 hours, whether a newer release than
this one is out (the update check, an Admin's choice), and what the page's
banner says to update, for this kind of install (TAPIOCA_INSTALL, set
in the YAML or compose file).

Nothing is asked of GitHub until an Admin says yes (the audit of 1.34.0):
a new server asks in setup's last step, and one updated from before 1.34.0
asks once, on the page. Even then, nothing is asked until setup is done.
Off, or not answered, it contacts nothing.

The check asks GitHub for tapiOca's latest release (api.github.com, its
public API: no account, nothing sent but the request itself, with
tapiOca's version in its User-Agent; GitHub sees the server's internet
address, as any website does). It asks by the repository's number, which
stays the same if the repository is renamed or moved. It waits 10 seconds,
follows no redirect, and keeps only the version found, its page's address
and when it looked. It never downloads anything, and never updates by
itself: each kind of install updates its image its own way, and the banner
says how (see STEPS).

The first start after an update says so in the log, once (note_version).
