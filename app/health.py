"""The server's health, now, for the Stats tab (Admins only): the processor
and memory tapiOca uses and the whole machine's, what it's sending and
receiving, and the data folder's free space; with the last HISTORY_S of
each, kept in memory only.

It's read from Linux's own files (/proc, and the cgroup files Docker gives
a container), every SAMPLE_S: a few small files, cheap enough to read
whether or not anyone's looking. Anything that isn't there (another system,
a container that hides it) is None: the Stats tab says "not available"
for it.

tapiOca's own use is its container's (its cgroup: tapiOca and the
ffmpegs it runs), or this process's alone where there's no cgroup to read.
Memory used is the cgroup's, less what the kernel can drop at once (files
it has read lately), as `docker stats` counts it. The machine's memory is
the container's limit, when it has one, rather than the machine's.
