"""Media in tapiOca's apps: the apps' own addresses for browsing
and playing it (under /api/internal; see docs/on-demand.md, and
docs/internal-api.md for the contract), the play sessions' own addresses,
and the Access tab's setting.

At home (and through a VPN, which looks like home), and through the public
port while watching away from home is on (see away.py): there, a signed-in
app does what it may at home, within the same Viewing Levels and limits, and
a program it starts plays at the Admin's quality away from home. A program's
own addresses (/play/<session>/...) are offered on the public port only for
a program an app started there, and only while it and that app's sign-in
last (see access.Access.play_outside, and session_or_404); one started at
home is never offered there.

The deciding is in ondemand.py; this is the asking and answering.
