"""How stations play: each one's picture size, how many can play at once
(its tuners), and how much the server can manage.

A station is one continuous stream in one fixed format, like a TV station:
every program, commercial and card on it is converted to that format as it
plays (H.264 at the station's picture size, in standard colour, with stereo
sound: see ff.PICTURES), so each follows the last without a seam, in any
player. 4K and HDR programs play too, at the station's size, their HDR made
ordinary (ff.to_sdr).

What new stations start with: their picture size, and the other settings in
NEW_STATION_CHOICES, as chosen in the welcome (or db.NEW_STATION's).

Tuners: tapiOca plays at most `tuners` different stations at once,
across Plex and every other app, since each is converted as it plays;
everyone watching one station shares its stream. Plex is told of more
tuners than that (announced), since it may count each person watching a
station as one. So when all of tapiOca's are in use, someone tuning in
to another station gets tapiOca's own card saying so (busy_stream),
rather than Plex's error.
