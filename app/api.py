"""tapiOca's API, version 1 (/api/v1): for anyone's scripts, home
automation and apps, documented in docs/api.md with an OpenAPI spec
(docs/openapi-v1.json, served at /api/v1/openapi.json), which the tests
check against the server.

Reading needs a Viewer API token (or any sign-in); doing needs an Admin one
(see access.py). While signing in is off, nothing needs a token on the home
network, as with the rest of tapiOca.

Version 1 is a stable contract: it only grows. New fields and addresses may
be added; nothing is renamed, removed or changed in meaning. A change that
would break a client becomes version 2, served beside version 1, which is
then marked with Deprecation and Sunset headers (DEPRECATED) for at least
six months before it goes.

What only tapiOca's own apps use is under /api/internal instead (see
appapi.py and applibrary.py): not part of this API, and free to change.
