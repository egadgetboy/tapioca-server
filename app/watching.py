"""Who's watching which station, as Plex says: its Live TV sessions
(/status/sessions), each matched to the station airing what it shows.

Plex's session for Live TV shows the program its guide has (tapiOca's
guide), the Plex user watching, and sometimes the channel's number. A
session is matched to one of the stations with viewers (`playing`: each
station's id -> its number, and what its schedule has on now): the one
airing that very program (its show and episode, or movie), else the one
airing that show; where Plex names a channel number, only a station with
that number. Two stations airing the same thing, with no number to tell
them apart, match neither.
