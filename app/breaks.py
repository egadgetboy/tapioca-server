"""Commercials, trailers and Station ID cards between programs.

A station can play 1, 2 or 3 commercials after each episode, or trailers
after each movie, and a short Station ID card saying what's up next. They
come from folders you keep beside your media: a folder called
`commercials` at the top of each TV library's folder, and `trailers` at the
top of each movie library's folder (add a `.plexignore` file containing `*`
to each, so Plex doesn't add them to your libraries).

Clips in a folder named for a decade (`commercials/1960s`, or `60s`) play
after programs from that decade, and only those; the rest play after
anything (and after a decade's programs when it has none of its own).

What follows each program is decided when a station's schedule is worked
out and becomes part of the program's run, so a restart or a viewer tuning
in partway through always lands in the right place. The clips are shared
out evenly: each one plays about as often as the others.
