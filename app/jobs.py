#     off the list once no station has it (taken off its stations on
#     purpose, say) and it isn't in Media, unless Sonarr or Radarr is
#     replacing it; a broken or damaged one stays, so it's never put on a
#     station again unnoticed;
#   * a version of a program (not the one a station plays) comes off the
#     list once Plex no longer has it;
#   * a program Plex no longer has under its key comes off the list if it's
#     in Plex again under a new key (added again: a file renamed, say), or
#     if no station has it any more; one removed from Plex that a station
#     still has stays, as broken ("removed from Plex");
#   * a new file for a program gets the quick check, and the program comes
#     off the list if it passes (otherwise its entry says what's wrong with
#     the new file).
# Every night, as the overnight checks' hours begin, and when you ask,
# besides those: a program the quick check, or opening its file, took off
# the air gets the quick check again (a share may have been down), and comes
# off the list if it passes. One the deep scan or playing it found a problem
# in stays until its file changes: checking the same file again finds the
