"""Specials: now and then something takes over a station's schedule for a
while, and then the station carries on exactly where it left off.

  * A marathon (see marathons.py): three episodes of one of its shows.
  * A Feature Presentation: on the days and at the time you set, a movie
    from a movie library, a collection or the station's own movies, opened
    by a card saying so, in the station's colours. Each movie waits its
    turn: the one shown longest ago (or never) is next.
  * A time-of-day block: on the days you set, from its start to its end,
    shows of its own, in the station's order (episode order or shuffle).
    Each time, it carries on from where it got to the time before.

Each starts at the program break nearest its time and is two eras (see
schedule.py): its own, then one carrying on the station's schedule from the
moment it took over, so nothing is skipped and nothing airs twice. A block
ends at the break in its own programs nearest its end time. Specials are
planned up to PLAN_AHEAD_MS ahead, well before any guide shows them, so a
guide never has to change for one. A change to the station (or an update
from Plex) takes over after any special already under way, and the
specials after it are planned again the same way: the same programs for
the same times.

When two would overlap, a block comes first, then a Feature Presentation,
then a marathon: the other is left out that time. One that would start
more than LATE_MS after its time, because the one before it ran on, is left
out too.
