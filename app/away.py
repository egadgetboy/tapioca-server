"""Watching away from home in tapiOca's own apps: optional, off unless
an Admin turns it on in the Access tab. Setups that use only Plex, Jellyfin
or other apps never see a difference.

What Plex, Jellyfin and other apps use stays on the home network (see access.py). An
app away from home reaches tapiOca one of two ways:

- Through a VPN (Tailscale, WireGuard), straight to the home port: as far as
  tapiOca can tell, it's at home, and everything works as it does there.
- Through the public port (PUBLIC_PORT, behind a reverse proxy), signed in.
  A player can't sign in, so there a station's stream has an address of its
  own for each signed-in app: /hls/k/<key>/<number>/... The key belongs to
  that app's sign-in. It stops working when the sign-in does (signing out, a
  new password, the user being removed), when this is turned off, and when
  tapiOca restarts (the app then asks for the stations again and gets a
  new one). Nothing about it is kept on disk.

The address set here (what the apps reach tapiOca at from outside) is
told to the apps (/api/v1/server), so an app set up at home remembers it and
uses it when home doesn't answer. Whether it really reaches tapiOca is
checked while this is on (see reach.py).

At home, each of tapiOca's own apps, signed in, gets its stations at an
address of its own too (and an API token's script does while only listed
devices may use the tuner: see tuner.py), so it needn't be listed, and
changing that never stops it: a key made for use at home, which works only
on the home port, whether or not this is on.

Media plays through the public port too, while this is on (see
applibrary.py), as fast as the Admin allows: Original (the file as it would
play at home), or up to a number of Mbps (MEDIA_MBPS_MOST at most), above
which a program is converted down to fit.
