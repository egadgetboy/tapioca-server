"""Stitching separate MPEG-TS outputs into one seamless stream.

Each program is encoded by its own ffmpeg process. Two things would make
the joins visible to a player, and both are handled here as the bytes pass
through:

* Continuity counters. Every ffmpeg process numbers its packets from zero,
  which a player reads as lost or corrupt packets at each program change.
  They are renumbered so the station looks like one unbroken mux.
* Timestamps. Each program's timeline is shifted to follow the previous
  one. The exact end of each program's audio and video is read from the
  stream itself, so the next program can start precisely after it: no
  overlap, and no gap beyond a millisecond.

A program's output is held back until its picture starts, so one that
ends without any picture sends nothing (see begin_segment).
