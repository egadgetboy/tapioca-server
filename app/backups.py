"""Backups of everything tapiOca keeps: stations and their schedules,
settings, the broken-files list, the tuner's identity, uploaded logos, who
can sign in (passwords only as hashes; not who's signed in) and viewing
statistics.

A backup is a zip file. One is made every night and the last KEEP are kept
in the data folder's backups/ folder; the web page can download one at any
time, and restore one.

Restoring never swaps files under a running tapiOca: the backup is
checked, unpacked into restore/ (and what's in it checked again: see
main.py), marked ready, and tapiOca restarts (Docker starts it again).
On the way up, before anything opens the database, the files are moved
into place, after a backup of what was there before. (Its Admin alerts are
left out: they were about when it was made. See _forget_alerts.)

Before an update changes the database (a new table or column, or anything
else Database does to bring one up to date: see db.changes_needed), the
database is copied as it is, sign-ins and all, to backups/ as
before-<version>-<date>.db (the newest BEFORE_KEPT kept), so going back to
the version before is putting that copy in place (see the README's
Updating). If the copy can't be made, tapiOca changes nothing and stops.
