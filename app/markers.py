"""Skipping intros and credits, using the markers Plex finds.

Plex works out where each episode's intro and each program's closing
credits are (its libraries' "Generate intro video markers" and "Generate
credits video markers" settings) and records them as markers. On a station
set to skip them, a program airs without them: whatever comes before the
intro (a cold open) plays, then the program carries on from the end of the
intro, and it ends where its final credits begin. Credits in the middle of
a program (a movie's credits with a scene after them) are skipped and the
scene still plays. This is what Plex's own players do with "Skip Intro" and
"Skip Credits".

The schedule uses each program's length without them, so the guide shows
when programs really start, and the next program follows straight on.

Markers are only trusted when they look right; otherwise the program plays
in full:
  * an intro must start in the first half of the program and be under five
    minutes long; credits must start in the second half;
  * skipping may not take away more than half of a program, or leave less
    than a minute of it;
  * scraps of under five seconds left between skipped parts (a logo before
    the intro, a second of black after the credits) are skipped too, so a
    program never flashes up for a moment.

Plex only includes markers when asked about one program at a time, so
they're asked for per program, and the answers are kept. A new answer is
checked again after six hours (Plex may not have got to a new episode yet,
or may still be working on a replaced file); each time it's the same, it's
trusted for longer, up to a week for programs with markers and three days
for programs without. A few programs Plex won't answer about don't hold a
station up: their last answer stands (or they play in full) until next time.
