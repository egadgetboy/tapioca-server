"""Marathons: now and then, a station plays three episodes of one of its
shows in a row, then carries on exactly where it left off.

A station with marathons on has them a few times a week: at random times
(any hour, on different days), or on the days and at the time you set. Each
is three episodes of one show, the one whose last marathon was longest ago:
the next three in order (picking up where its last marathon ended), or a
random stretch of three. A station needs at least MIN_SHOWS shows with
three or more episodes each (that play: broken files are left out).

They're planned with the station's other specials (see specials.py).
