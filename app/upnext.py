"""The Up Next Banner: three minutes before a show or movie ends, a banner in
the bottom-left corner says what's on next. It shows the station's logo,
"UP NEXT" and the next show or movie for 3, 5 or 10 seconds, sliding in and
then fading away. If the station's corner logo is in that corner, the banner
takes its place: its own logo is drawn the same size in exactly the same
place, and the corner logo fades into it and back.

It's drawn once per program as a picture, in the logo's colours like the
Station ID card, while the program's file is being opened. On the air it's
laid over the program (see ffmpeg.Banner).
