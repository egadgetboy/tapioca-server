"""Keeping stations from some Plex users: optional, off unless it's set up
on the Access tab. It's done through Plex alone, and needs Plex Pass.

Plex can't hide one station from one person: every station is in the guide
of everyone with Live TV on this server. So instead, while a station kept
from someone has viewers, Plex is asked every FAST_S seconds what it's
playing to whom (by stats.WhoWatches, which asks anyway for the Stats tab),
and a Plex user's Live TV session watching a station kept from them is
stopped, with a message saying why. That's Plex's own "stop playback",
which works only with Plex Pass on the server owner's account. They can
tune in again; it's stopped again.

It's stopped only when tapiOca is sure which station that is
(sure_station): the one station of those with viewers airing what the
session shows, nothing Plex says about it naming another channel, and
either that very program (its show and episode, or movie) or Plex naming
the station's channel number. Anything less, and it's left playing (and
the log says why, once).

It covers anyone watching through Plex on this server, as Plex names them:
you, Plex Home members (managed users too), and friends you've shared Live
TV with. Watching through other apps (the M3U playlist) isn't seen.
