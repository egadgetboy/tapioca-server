# tapiOca's apps: their own addresses

> **Internal: for tapiOca's own apps only.** This isn't a public API. It
> isn't in the OpenAPI spec, and it may change with any release. For your
> own scripts and players, use tapiOca's API (`docs/api.md`).

tapiOca's own apps (iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, Android, Google TV and
Android TV, Roku) use these addresses, under `/api/internal`, for signing in,
connection tests and Media. For the server, its stations and their guide,
the apps use tapiOca's API (`docs/api.md`), and they play stations as it
describes.

The API's rules (`docs/api.md`) apply here too. Every answer carries the
header `StationPlay-API: 1`. Addresses in answers are relative to the
server. Times are milliseconds since 1970 (UTC). An error is an HTTP status
with `{"detail": "..."}`. The apps ignore fields they don't know.

These addresses change only along with the apps that use them. The
server's tests (`tests/test_app_api.py`) check the tables below against the
server, so this document and the server can't drift apart.

## Signing in

When tapiOca has users (signing in is on), an app signs in one of two
ways, and gets a token to send with every request:

- **With a code.** This suits TVs, and anything without a handy keyboard.
  The app shows a code. Someone signed in on tapiOca's page enters it
  at `/link`, sees which app on which device it is, and links it to their
  account. No password is typed on a remote or sent by the TV. See
  `POST /api/internal/link`.
- **With a name and password.** This works as on tapiOca's page. See
  `POST /api/internal/sign-in`.

Either way, the app then sends its token with every request:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

A token lasts 30 days from when it was last used, like a browser's sign-in.
It ends when the app signs out, when its person gets a new password or is
removed, and when an Admin signs that app out under **Signed-in apps** on
the **Access** tab. That list shows each app by the name and device it
gave. Sign-ins, links and sign-outs show in the access log. Apps keep their
token where only they can read it (the Keychain on Apple devices, Android's
Keystore, a Roku's own storage for the app), and never show it.

From the internet (the public port), apps connect only over HTTPS. Anything
under `/api/v1`, `/api/internal`, `/hls/k/` or `/play/` that didn't come
over HTTPS is refused with 403. (The reverse proxy in front reports this
with `X-Forwarded-Proto`.) The only exception is tapiOca's check of
itself (`GET /api/internal/reach`). On the home network, and through a VPN,
plain HTTP is fine.

Wrong passwords are limited as on tapiOca's page. After 5 wrong ones
from one address within 15 minutes, signing in from there must wait (HTTP
429).

When signing in is off, nothing needs a token on the home network.

### Linked devices, and Who's tuning in?

An app may show a picker of the people who use the device, such as a
household's TV (see `docs/users.md`). It says so with `"picker": true` when
it signs in or asks for a code. The device is then **linked**. The first
time, the answer carries a `deviceKey`. The app keeps it where only it can
read it, and sends it as a header with every picker request:

```
StationPlay-Device: <deviceKey>
```

From then on, the app opens on the picker (`GET /api/internal/picker`).
Whoever is using it picks themselves (`POST /api/internal/picker/choose`,
with their PIN if they have one) or signs in by name
(`POST /api/internal/picker/sign-in`). Either gives a token for that
person, as signing in does. This token lasts a day from when it was last
used, and picking someone else ends it.

A device key lasts until an Admin unlinks the device on the **Access** tab.
That also signs out whoever is signed in on it. Anything asked with its key
then answers 401, and the app links again.

An app shows the picker when it lists more than one person, or one person
with a PIN. Otherwise it picks that person itself. (An Admin without a
PIN gives their password only on a device others use too. From 1.38.0, an
Admin picked with nothing is signed in for watching: see What 1.38.0 asks
of the apps.)

Apps that don't send `"picker": true` sign in as they always have, and get
no `deviceKey`.

### A PIN, after the first sign-in

From 1.28.0, three sign-in answers carry `askPin`: signing in with a
password or an invite code (`POST /api/internal/sign-in`,
`POST /api/internal/picker/sign-in`), or with a code entered on
tapiOca's page (`POST /api/internal/link/check`). `askPin` says whether
to ask this person, right then, to choose a 4-digit PIN for picking
themselves on Who's tuning in? (The fields call it `pin`.) It's true while
they have none and haven't chosen to have none. Offer both:

- **A PIN.** 4 digits, typed twice to be sure, sent with
  `POST /api/internal/pin` as `{"pin": "1234"}`. From then on, picking them
  on any device asks for it.
- **No PIN.** Send `{"pin": null}`. They aren't asked again, on any
  device. For an Admin, explain what that means: on a device others use
  too, they give their password instead.

If they leave without choosing, they're asked again the next time they sign
in with their password or a code. Someone with a PIN isn't asked. The
app's Options shows whether they have one (`user.pin` in
`GET /api/internal/me`), so they can choose a new one there, or none. An
Admin who has a PIN can't remove it in an app. That's refused, with
the sentence to show, so offer an Admin only a new one.

### What 1.28.0 asks of the apps

1. **Who's tuning in?** Ask `GET /api/internal/picker` each time the picker
   shows, and again when the app comes back to the front. A device lists
   fewer people away from home than at home. When picking someone answers
   404, they aren't on this device's list where it is now, so ask for the
   list again.
2. **After signing in** with a password, an invite code or a code entered on
   tapiOca's page: when `askPin` is true, ask for a PIN (typed
   twice) or No PIN, and send it with `POST /api/internal/pin`.
3. **Options.** Ask `GET /api/internal/me` when Options opens. Show whether
   the person has a PIN (`user.pin`), with Change PIN and No
   PIN (not for an Admin who has one). Show Change password only while
   `user.canChangePassword` is true (`POST /api/internal/password`), and
   keep the `token` it answers with in place of the app's.
4. **Every refusal** carries a sentence to show unchanged (`detail`).

A server before 1.28.0 doesn't send `askPin`, `user.pin` or
`user.canChangePassword`, and doesn't have the two new addresses. Without
those fields, leave out what they'd offer.

On the public port, only `GET /api/v1/server` (and tapiOca's check of
itself) answers until signing in is on. API tokens (`docs/api.md`) don't
work on these addresses, which are for the apps' own sign-ins.

## What 1.29.0 asks of the apps

1. **Options: Audio language and Subtitles.** Ask `GET /api/internal/me`
   when Options opens. Offer **Audio language** (each file's own, or one of
   `languages.choices`, listed by `name`) and **Subtitles**: on or off, and
   their language (the audio's, or one of `choices`). Save each change with
   `PUT /api/internal/languages`. It applies on every device the person
   uses (see Languages).
2. **Playing.** Send `device.subtitles` with `POST /api/internal/play`: the
   subtitle formats the player shows itself. Don't send `audio` or
   `subtitle` when a program starts, since tapiOca chooses from the
   person's languages. When `chosen` isn't null, select `chosen.audio` and
   `chosen.subtitle` in the player. (A separate subtitle file comes from
   `subtitles[].url`. One that's `drawnSubtitle` is already in the
   picture.) Show `chosen.audioWhy` and `chosen.subtitleWhy` in the
   player's info. When `chosen` is null, the player chooses, as before.
3. **The player's Audio & subtitles.** Offer **Remember for the whole
   show** (**Sticky Audio & Subtitles** from 1.34.0), on by default for an
   episode. (A movie's choice belongs to the
   movie.) When the viewer chooses a sound track, or subtitles (or none),
   save it with `PUT /api/internal/items/{key}/languages`:
   - With it on, save it for the show (`showKey`), and clear the episode's
     own choice (`DELETE` its key) so the show's applies.
   - With it off, save it for the episode alone (or the movie).
   - Send the track's `languageCode` as `audio`. For subtitles, send
     `captions: true` and their `languageCode` as `captionLanguage`. For a
     forced track, or none, send `captions: false`.
   - A track whose `languageCode` is null can't be saved, so leave that one
     out.

   Then switch tracks as before. The player switches among a file's own
   tracks. For a copy, ask `POST /api/internal/play` again, with `audio` and
   `subtitle` as the viewer has them (null for none) and `startMs` where
   they are, and `POST` the old one's `leave`.
4. **Alerts, for Admins.** For an Admin (`user.role` is `admin`, or signing
   in is off), ask `GET /api/internal/alerts` when the app opens and comes
   back to the front, and every few minutes while it's open. Show the
   current alerts, each `sentence` unchanged with how long it's lasted (see
   Admin alerts), and show when one is fixed.
   - Android also asks every 15 minutes in the background (WorkManager). It
     notifies once for each new `id`, and once when it's fixed.
   - Apple's apps also ask when iOS lets them refresh in the background, as
     well as when they open.
   - The Roku app shows how many there are in the guide's header, which
     opens the list.
5. **PIN.** From 1.31.0, tapiOca's page and its sentences say "PIN"
   (1.28.0 to 1.30.0 used another word); the apps say the same. The fields
   were always `pin`.

A server before 1.29.0 doesn't send `languages` (in `GET /api/internal/me`
and an item's details), `chosen` or `languageCode`, and answers 404 for the
new addresses. Without them, leave out what they'd offer (and show no
alerts).

## What 1.30.0 asks of the apps

1. **Progress in order.** Number each playing's progress reports
   (`sequence`: 1, 2, 3..., from 1 again for each `POST /api/internal/play`).
   Then one that arrives late never moves the viewer back (see
   `POST /api/internal/progress`). Send the last one as the player stops,
   before its `leave`.
2. **One program at a time.** Starting a program ends the one the device
   was playing (its addresses answer 404). Ask for the next episode when
   it's time to play it, not while another plays. Switching sound tracks
   or versions works as before.
3. **Up next from tapiOca.** Show a show's `next`, and the Resume row,
   as they come (see Up next and the Resume row). Don't work out what's
   next in the app. When an episode ends and the next should play, report
   where it ended, then ask for its show's details for `next`.
4. **A show's episodes a page at a time.**
   `GET /api/internal/items/{key}/episodes` answers up to 500 at once (a
   whole season, for all but the longest), with `total` and `start`. While
   `start` plus the episodes you have is less than `total`, ask for more
   with `?start=`.
5. **Pictures.** Keep each one a day, by its address. Then ask with
   `If-None-Match` and its `ETag`. A 304 means the one you have is still
   current.
6. **503 means try again.** When Plex is slow or unreachable, Media's
   addresses answer within 8 seconds with 503 and a sentence to show. Offer
   to try again. What was being fetched carries on, so it's often ready a
   moment later.
7. **A restricted program (from 1.39.0).** For someone with limits, while a
   program they may not watch is on a station, its HLS playlist and its
   pieces answer 403 with `{"detail": "This program is restricted. Your
   station will resume automatically when permitted programming returns.",
   "code": "restricted", "resumesAtMs": ...}` (`resumesAtMs`: when the
   schedule says permitted programming is back, or null). Keep the station
   selected, show the sentence over its picture, and ask for the playlist
   again every few seconds until it plays (`resumesAtMs` is for showing when;
   keep asking anyway, as what's really played decides, and a stream nobody
   asks for stops after 30 seconds). While it asks, the device keeps its
   place among the devices an Admin allows, so it's never turned away when
   the station comes back. Never retune elsewhere on your own, and
   don't bring them back if they've gone to another screen. Casting (a
   Chromecast or AirPlay receiver gets the same 403 and stops): show the
   sentence on the phone, keep asking, and cast again when it plays. Guides
   list such a program with `restricted: true` and the title "Restricted
   program".
8. **Report a problem.** Offer it on a movie's or an episode's page, in the
   player's menu, and in a station's player, when `user.canReport` is true
   in `GET /api/internal/me` (and always while signing in is off). When
   it's chosen, ask `GET /api/internal/report-choices` for the choices. Show
   them under their groups, in order, and never a list of your own. Send
   the one picked with `POST /api/internal/report-problem`:
   - Send the key, or for a station's player, the station's number.
   - From a player, also send where it is (`positionMs`) and how it's
     playing (`method`, `version`, `audio`, `subtitle`).
   - Show the answer's `detail` unchanged ("Thanks. An Admin will take a
     look."). Show a refusal's `detail` unchanged too, such as a limit
     ("You've reported this one today. Thanks.") or reporting turned off.

   See Reporting a problem.
9. **What's broken doesn't play.** A version tapiOca found broken never
   plays. When another version plays in its place, `why` says so (for
   `direct` too, so show it in the player's info). When every version is
   broken, the answer is 422 with the `detail` "This one can't play right
   now. An Admin has been told." Show it unchanged. An item's
   `versions[].problem` shows what was found in each version (`broken` or
   `damaged`). Mark a broken one, so the viewer chooses another.
10. **Problems say what and where.** With `library-failed` and
   `library-stopped`, send the playing's `session` and `positionMs` (see
   `POST /api/internal/problem`). tapiOca checks that file at that point
   first.
11. **Alerts about files.** For an Admin, alerts may now be `files` (see
    Admin alerts). Notify once for each `id`, as for any other alert. If
    the app links to tapiOca's page, offer a way to its **Broken files**
    tab.

A server before 1.30.0 ignores `sequence`. It answers a show's episodes all
at once without `total` and `start` (take them as the whole list), and
sends pictures without an `ETag`. It doesn't send `user.canReport`,
`versions[].problem` or `files` alerts, and answers 404 for the report
addresses. Without them, don't offer Report a problem.

## What 1.32.0 asks of the apps

Nothing new is required.

1. **Stations' own addresses at home.** A signed-in app's stations at
   home now come with `/hls/k/` addresses of its own, for `hls`, `nightHls`
   and `logo`, as they do away from home, whatever an Admin chooses under
   **Tuner access**. So switching to **Only these devices** never stops an
   app that's signed in. A home address stops working when tapiOca
   restarts, as one away from home does. The apps already ask
   `GET /api/v1/stations` again when a `/hls/k/` address answers 404,
   wherever they are: keep doing that. Right after updating to 1.32.0, an
   app still has the tuner's own addresses until it next asks for its
   stations (when it starts, and every 10 minutes).
2. **Only the apps' own addresses.** Keep using only the addresses
   tapiOca gives the apps, never the tuner's: not `/art/`, `/stream/`,
   `/hls/<number>/` asked for directly, or `xmltv.xml`. While only listed
   devices may use the tuner, those are refused to the apps' devices.
3. **The page's PIN sign-in.** tapiOca's page now lets someone sign in
   with their PIN at home, on a browser where they've signed in with their
   password. Nothing changes for the apps.
4. **Night mode's sound.** `nightHls`, and copies asked for with `night`,
   now only ever turn sound down, never up.

## What 1.34.0 asks of the apps

1. **Automatic subtitles, the new default.** Someone who hasn't turned
   subtitles on or off gets them in their language when the sound is in
   another, and not otherwise (see Languages). In Options, offer
   **Subtitles** as **Automatic**, **On** or **Off**, from
   `languages.subtitles` in `GET /api/internal/me`, and save a change with
   `PUT /api/internal/languages` and `{"subtitles": "automatic"}` (or `on`,
   `off`). Offer **Subtitles language** for Automatic and On. While it's
   null, show "Your device's language" for Automatic and "Same as the audio"
   for On.
2. **The device's language.** Send `language` with
   `POST /api/internal/play`: the device's own language setting, as the
   system gives it (such as `en-US`). It's how Automatic subtitles know
   your language when you haven't chosen a Subtitles language. Without it,
   Automatic doesn't apply: subtitles nobody turned on or off are off, as
   before 1.34.0, so an older app plays exactly as it did.
3. **Sticky Audio & Subtitles.** The player's Audio & subtitles
   switch, **Remember for the whole show** until now, is called **Sticky
   Audio & Subtitles**, with the line "Keep these for every episode of this
   show." It works as before (see What 1.29.0 asks of the apps). The
   reasons in `chosen` now say so for a show's choice ("Japanese, kept for
   this show by Sticky Audio", or "by Sticky Subtitles"). Show them as they
   come.

A server before 1.34.0 doesn't send `languages.subtitles` and ignores
`language`. Without `subtitles`, offer Subtitles On or Off from
`languages.captions`, as before.

## What 1.35.0 asks of the apps

Nothing new is required.

1. **Media folders of tapiOca's own.** A Media folder, show, movie or
   episode may come from folders tapiOca reads itself, with or without
   Plex. Its key is `f` and digits (`f2`, `f812`). Treat every key as an
   opaque string, as before: they come, list and play exactly as Plex's
   do. A server may have no Plex at all.
2. **What they don't have yet.** No Skip intro or Skip credits (an
   episode's `markers.intro` and `markers.credits` are null), and a title
   may have no picture (`/api/internal/art` answers 404): show what the
   app shows for any title without one.

## What 1.36.0 asks of the apps

Nothing is required: an app that does nothing new signs in as before.

1. **Trusted networks.** An Admin may list home networks, or single
   devices, whose devices skip signing in. When an app has no sign-in (or
   its sign-in gets 401), it asks `POST /api/internal/trusted` (below)
   before showing Sign in. A 403 or 404 (a server before 1.36.0) means:
   sign in as before.
   - `"gives": "picker"`: keep the `deviceKey` and open on Who's tuning
     in?, as any linked device does (`GET /api/internal/picker`). People
     with a PIN are asked for it, and an Admin always gives their PIN or
     password. The key works only on that network: anywhere else the
     picker's addresses answer 403 ("This device skips signing in only on
     its trusted network. Sign in to use tapiOca here."): keep the key,
     and offer Sign in.
   - `"gives": "person"`: keep the `token`, as after `POST
     /api/internal/sign-in`. It works only on that network (401
     elsewhere).
   - After someone signs out on purpose, show Sign in, and don't ask again
     until the app is opened again.
2. **A new alert kind, `access`:** how tapiOca is reached (the home port
   reached from the internet, a proxy pointed at it, forwarding headers
   from a device that isn't a trusted proxy, signing in off). Show its
   sentence as it comes, as for every kind.

## What 1.38.0 asks of the apps

Nothing new is required, but the picker lists fewer people (the owner,
October 17).

1. **Who's listed.** A device's Who's tuning in? lists someone only once
   they signed in on that device themselves: with their password
   (`POST /api/internal/sign-in` or `POST /api/internal/picker/sign-in`),
   an invite code, or a code entered on tapiOca's page
   (`POST /api/internal/link`). Never because they're at home, their Show
   on says so, or an Admin chose the device. So a device just linked lists
   only whoever linked it, and a device a trusted network linked lists no
   one at first. Always offer **Sign in** on the picker, even when it's
   empty. Signing in there by name makes a network's device an ordinary
   linked device, as before.
2. **Invite codes for people with no password or PIN.** Someone with
   neither (a "Kids" user) gets on a device with an invite code, through
   `POST /api/internal/picker/sign-in` with `name` and `code`. Before
   1.38.0 that was refused. They're then listed only at home, where anyone
   there can pick them, so `GET /api/internal/picker` leaves them out away
   from home. A password for them is still refused (403).
3. **An Admin's password on the picker.** An Admin may send `password` in
   place of `pin` with `POST /api/internal/picker/choose`, PIN or not. That
   gives an Admin's sign-in. Offer "Use your password" beside the PIN pad
   for an Admin (`people[].admin`).
4. **Sign-ins for watching.** An Admin's sign-in is for watching, with no
   Admin tasks, when they were picked:
   - with their PIN in Full sign-in;
   - with their PIN in Light sign-in, but away from home, or on a device
     they joined only with an invite code;
   - with nothing (no PIN, alone on their own device).

   Anything only an Admin may do (`GET /api/internal/alerts`, say) then
   answers 403 with this `detail`, to show unchanged: "You signed in
   without your password, so this sign-in is for watching. For Admin
   tasks, sign out, then sign in with your password." (A trusted network's
   sign-in still answers "This device signed you in without your password.
   For Admin tasks, sign out, then choose Sign in with a password.")
   `GET /api/internal/me`
   says `user.role` is `user` for it, so take the role from there before
   asking for Admin alerts.
5. **A new role.** When someone's role changes, all their sign-ins end, so
   the app gets 401 and they sign in or pick themselves again.

A server before 1.38.0 lists people by their Show on, as before.

## POST /api/internal/trusted

What an app gets on a trusted network (1.36.0). Open to anyone; refused
(403, "This device isn't on a trusted network. Sign in to tapiOca.")
anywhere but on one. Send:

```json
{"app": "tapiOca for Roku", "deviceName": "Living Room Roku", "picker": true,
 "deviceKey": "..."}
```

`picker`: the app has Who's tuning in? (a network that opens on it answers
403 to an app without it). `deviceKey`, optional: a key this network gave
before; if it's still good, none new is made. From 1.38.0, the device's
picker lists only people who signed in on it themselves, so at first no
one: offer Sign in. Signing in on it by name makes it an ordinary linked
device.

| Field | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `gives` | string | `picker` (open on Who's tuning in?) or `person` (signed in as someone) |
| `deviceKey` | string or null | For `picker`: the device's key, to keep (null: the one sent is still good) |
| `token` | string | For `person`: the sign-in, as `POST /api/internal/sign-in` gives |
| `user` | object | For `person`: who |
| `user.name` | string | Their name |
| `user.role` | string | Always `user`: a network's sign-in is for watching, an Admin a User there |
| `user.byNetwork` | boolean | Always true (see `GET /api/internal/me`) |
| `askPin` | boolean | For `person`: always false |

## POST /api/internal/link

Open to anyone. Starts signing in with a code. Send which app this is, and
the device's own name, as the **Access** tab will list it:

```json
{"app": "tapiOca for Roku", "deviceName": "Living Room Roku", "picker": true,
 "deviceKey": "..."}
```

`picker` and `deviceKey` are optional. Send `picker` from an app with a
picker, and `deviceKey` if the app already has one (see Linked devices,
above).

Show `code`, and where to enter it: tapiOca's page at `linkAt`. An app
that knows the page's address shows it in full, such as
`http://192.168.1.20:3310/link`. Then send `poll` to
`POST /api/internal/link/check` every `interval` seconds, until it answers
with a token or the code expires. Keep `poll` inside the app: whoever has it
gets the sign-in.

| Field | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `code` | string | The code to show, such as `K7QM-4DPX` |
| `poll` | string | The app's secret for checking back |
| `expiresIn` | number | Seconds until the code runs out (600) |
| `interval` | number | Seconds between checks (3) |
| `linkAt` | string | Where on tapiOca's page the code is entered |

Answers 400 when signing in is off, and 429 when one address has asked for
too many codes recently.

## POST /api/internal/link/check

Open to anyone. Send `{"poll": "..."}`. It answers 202 (`{"detail": ...}`)
while the code is waiting to be entered, and 404 once the code has expired
(start again). Once it's linked, it answers with the sign-in, just once:

| Field | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `token` | string | Send it as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` |
| `deviceKey` | string or null | For an app with a picker: the device's key, to keep; null when the one sent is still good, or for an app without one |
| `user` | object | Who linked it |
| `user.name` | string | Their name |
| `user.role` | string | `admin` or `user` |
| `askPin` | boolean | Whether to ask them now to choose a PIN, or none (from 1.28.0: see A PIN, after the first sign-in) |

## POST /api/internal/sign-in

Open to anyone. Send:

```json
{"name": "Sam", "password": "...", "device": "...",
 "app": "tapiOca for iPhone", "deviceName": "Sam's iPhone"}
```

`device` is optional. It's the `device` from an earlier sign-in on this
device. With it, this device can still sign in while too many wrong
passwords from the internet hold everyone else back, as a browser that has
signed in before can. `app` and `deviceName` are optional too: they're how
the **Access** tab lists this sign-in. So are `picker` and `deviceKey`, for
an app with a picker (see Linked devices, above).

| Field | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `token` | string | Send it as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` |
| `device` | string or null | Keep it, and send it when signing in again; null when the `device` sent is still good |
| `deviceKey` | string or null | For an app with a picker: the device's key, to keep; null when the one sent is still good, or for an app without one |
| `user` | object | Who signed in |
| `user.name` | string | Their name |
| `user.role` | string | `admin` or `user` |
| `askPin` | boolean | Whether to ask them now to choose a PIN, or none (from 1.28.0: see A PIN, after the first sign-in) |

Answers 401 for a wrong name or password, 429 while signing in must wait,
and 400 when signing in is off.

## GET /api/internal/picker

Sent with the device's key (`StationPlay-Device`; see Linked devices). It
lists who can be picked on this device, by name, where the device is now.
From 1.38.0, that's only those who signed in on this device themselves,
with their password, an invite code, or a code entered on tapiOca's page.
Someone with neither a password nor a PIN is listed only at home (on the
home network, or through a VPN). So a device just linked lists only
whoever linked it. Ask again when the app comes back to the front, since
the device may have moved.

(1.28.0 to 1.37.1 also listed those an Admin chose the device for, those
shown on every device, and at home, those shown on every device at home.)

| Field | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `device` | string | This device, as the **Access** tab lists it |
| `people` | list | Who's on its picker |
| `people[].id` | number | Who they are, for `POST /api/internal/picker/choose` |
| `people[].name` | string | Their name |
| `people[].pin` | boolean | Whether picking them asks for their PIN |
| `people[].admin` | boolean | Whether they're an Admin (picking an Admin with no PIN asks for their password) |

Answers 401 when the key isn't valid (the device was unlinked, so link it
again), and 400 when signing in is off.

## POST /api/internal/picker/choose

Sent with the device's key. Picks someone on its picker:

```json
{"id": 3, "pin": "1234"}
```

Send `pin` (their PIN) when they have one. Send `password` instead for
an Admin with no PIN on a device others use too (its picker lists more
than one person). From 1.38.0, an Admin may always send `password` in
place of `pin`, for an Admin's sign-in. Picked with their PIN, an Admin
gets Admin tasks only in Light sign-in, at home, on a device they signed
in on with their password; otherwise, and when picked with nothing, the
sign-in is for watching (see What 1.38.0 asks of the apps).

| Field | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `token` | string | Send it as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` |
| `user` | object | Who was picked |
| `user.name` | string | Their name |
| `user.role` | string | `admin` or `user` (`user` for an Admin's sign-in for watching, as `GET /api/internal/me` says) |
| `user.watching` | boolean | (From 1.38.0; only when true) An Admin picked for watching: with their PIN in Full sign-in, or in Light away from home or on a device they haven't signed in on with their password, or with nothing. Admin tasks need their password (`WATCHING_ONLY`) |

Answers 403 for a wrong PIN or password (with the sentence to show).
Answers 429 after 5 wrong PINs for that person in 15 minutes, on any
device. Answers 404 for someone not on this device's picker where it is
now, such as someone listed only at home while the device is away from
home. 401 always means the device isn't linked anymore, here and on every
picker address, so link it again.

## POST /api/internal/picker/sign-in

Sent with the device's key. Signs in by name, with an invite code or a
password. (An Admin makes invite codes on the **Access** tab, and each one
works once.)

```json
{"name": "Tia", "code": "K7QM-4DPX"}
```

Send `password` instead of `code`, or send `secret` for a single box where
either is typed. tapiOca treats `secret` as an invite code if it is
one, and otherwise as a password. Whoever signs in is on this device's
picker from then on.

| Field | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `token` | string | Send it as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` |
| `user` | object | Who signed in |
| `user.name` | string | Their name |
| `user.role` | string | `admin` or `user` |
| `askPin` | boolean | Whether to ask them now to choose a PIN, or none (from 1.28.0: see A PIN, after the first sign-in) |

Answers 403, with the sentence to show, for a wrong name, code or password.
Someone with neither a password nor a PIN signs in here only with an invite
code (from 1.38.0; before, they couldn't). They're then on this device's
picker at home only.

## POST /api/internal/picker/remove

Sent with the device's key and the token of whoever is signed in on it.
Takes them off this device's picker, and signs them out. Answers
`{"ok": true}`.

| Field | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `ok` | boolean | Always true |

## GET /api/internal/me

From 1.27.0, shows who this app is signed in as now, for its Options. An
Admin can rename people, so ask again when Options shows, rather than keep
the name from signing in. (Who's tuning in? lists everyone by their current
name.) From 1.29.0, it includes their languages too. Answers 401 when the
sign-in has ended.

| Field | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `user` | object or null | Who it is; null while signing in is off |
| `user.name` | string | Their name, now |
| `user.role` | string | `admin` or `user` |
| `user.pin` | boolean | Whether they have a PIN (from 1.28.0) |
| `user.canChangePassword` | boolean | Whether they may change their password in the app (from 1.28.0): false for someone without a password, and for someone an Admin turned that off for. Offer Change password only when it's true |
| `user.canChangePin` | boolean | Whether they may change their own PIN in the app (from 1.36.2): false for someone an Admin turned that off for (never an Admin). Offer changing the PIN only when it's true |
| `user.canReport` | boolean | Whether they may report a problem (from 1.30.0: see Reporting a problem): false for someone an Admin turned that off for. Offer Report a problem only when it's true (and while signing in is off, always) |
| `user.byNetwork` | boolean | (From 1.36.0; only when true) A trusted network signed them in: the sign-in is for watching. An Admin is a User then (`user.role` says `user`), with no Admin alerts; for Admin tasks they sign in with their password. (From 1.38.0, an Admin's other sign-ins for watching also say `user`, without `byNetwork`) |
| `user.watching` | boolean | (From 1.38.0; only when true) An Admin's sign-in for watching, however it was made (a trusted network's, their PIN without Light sign-in's Admin tools, or away from home): `user.role` says `user`, and Admin tasks need their password |
| `languages` | object | Their own languages, for Options (from 1.29.0: see Languages); while signing in is off, everyone's |
| `languages.audio` | object or null | The sound's language; null: each file's default track |
| `languages.audio.code` | string | Its code, such as `jpn` |
| `languages.audio.name` | string | Its name, such as "Japanese" |
| `languages.captions` | boolean | Whether subtitles are On (false for Automatic and Off) |
| `languages.subtitles` | string | Subtitles: `automatic`, `on` or `off` (from 1.34.0: see Languages) |
| `languages.captionLanguage` | object or null | The subtitles' language; null: for On, the language of the sound that plays; for Automatic, the device's |
| `languages.captionLanguage.code` | string | Its code |
| `languages.captionLanguage.name` | string | Its name |
| `languages.choices` | list | Every language tapiOca knows, A to Z by name, to choose from |
| `languages.choices[].code` | string | Its code |
| `languages.choices[].name` | string | Its name |

## PUT /api/internal/languages

From 1.29.0, sets the person's own languages for every device, as chosen
in the app's Options (see Languages). Send it with the app's token, or
without one while signing in is off. Send only what changes. What isn't
sent stays unchanged:

```json
{"audio": "jpn", "captions": true, "captionLanguage": "eng"}
```

`audio` and `captionLanguage` are a language's code, or null. For `audio`,
null means each file's default track. For `captionLanguage`, null means the
sound's language with subtitles On, and the device's with Automatic.
`subtitles` (from 1.34.0) is `automatic`, `on` or `off`. An app before
1.34.0 sends `captions` instead, true (On) or false (Off); send one or the
other, never both. It only ever sets the languages of the person signed
in, and anything else sent is ignored. Answers 400, with the sentence to
show, for a language tapiOca doesn't know, for `subtitles` that isn't
one of the three, for `captions` that isn't true or false, and for both
sent at once.

| Field | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `audio` | object or null | The sound's language, as in `GET /api/internal/me` |
| `audio.code` | string | Its code |
| `audio.name` | string | Its name |
| `captions` | boolean | Whether subtitles are On |
| `subtitles` | string | `automatic`, `on` or `off` (from 1.34.0, when the app sent `subtitles`) |
| `captionLanguage` | object or null | The subtitles' language |
| `captionLanguage.code` | string | Its code |
| `captionLanguage.name` | string | Its name |

## POST /api/internal/pin

From 1.28.0, the person signed in chooses their own PIN, with the
app's token. Send `{"pin": "1234"}` (exactly 4 digits, each 0 to 9), or
`{"pin": null}` for none. None removes any PIN they have, and they
aren't asked again, on any device.

A sign-in made with their password, an invite code or their PIN
proves it's them. So a new PIN needs nothing more, even to replace one
they have. A sign-in made by picking them on Who's tuning in? without a
PIN doesn't prove it, since anyone at that device could have done it.
From 1.28.1, such a sign-in can't set or remove a PIN, so sign in with
a password or an invite code first.

The access log shows "Tia set a PIN in tapiOca for Android on
Tia's phone" or "Tia chose no PIN in ...".

| Field | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `pin` | boolean | Whether they have a PIN now |

Answers 400 for a PIN that isn't 4 digits, and 400 while signing in is
off. Answers 403, with the sentence to show:

- **An Admin removing theirs.** An Admin needs a PIN, or their
  password on a device others use too.
- **Someone without a password removing theirs.** It's how they sign in.
- **Someone with neither** a password nor a PIN, such as "Kids." Only
  an Admin gives them one.
- **A sign-in made by picking someone** without a PIN (from 1.28.1).
- **A browser's sign-in,** since this is for the apps.

Wrong PINs tried recently still count after a new one is chosen: 5
within 15 minutes still means a wait.

## POST /api/internal/password

From 1.28.0, the person signed in changes their own password, as on
tapiOca's page, with the app's token. Send their current password and
the new one:

```json
{"current": "...", "new": "..."}
```

A new password has at least 8 characters (and at most 200; 12 in 1.36.2 and 1.36.3), isn't one of the most common, and isn't built from the person's name or tapiOca's (see the README's Passwords). As on
tapiOca's page, every other sign-in of theirs ends (other apps,
browsers and pickers). The app's own token ends too. The app carries on
with `token`, which it keeps in place of the old one. The access log shows
"Sam changed their password in tapiOca for Android on Sam's phone."

| Field | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `token` | string | The app's new token: send it from now on |

Answers 400, with the sentence to show, when the current password is wrong
or the new one isn't allowed. Answers 429 after 5 wrong ones from one
address within 15 minutes, as signing in does. Answers 403, with the
sentence to show:

- **Changing it is turned off.** An Admin has turned off changing their own
  password for them. `canChangePassword` in `GET /api/internal/me` shows
  this beforehand. An Admin can always change their own.
- **No password.** For someone without a password (a PIN-only person,
  or "Kids"), an Admin gives them one.
- **A browser's sign-in.**

Answers 400 while signing in is off.

## POST /api/internal/sign-out

Ends the token it's sent with. Answers `{"ok": true}`.

| Field | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `ok` | boolean | Always true |

## GET /api/internal/speed-test

A connection test: data for the app to time. It shows the Admin how fast
tapiOca reaches devices (at home, and away from home, where it's the
home internet's upload) and how many can watch at once. `?mb=` is how many
megabytes to send (1 to 64; 20 if it isn't given). The data is random, so
nothing along the way can compress it, and it has a `Content-Length`.

An app times it from a moment after the data starts, so the connection's
startup isn't counted. It may stop reading after about 8 seconds on a slow
connection. Each address can run one test at a time: another within 10
seconds gets 429.

## POST /api/internal/speed-test

What the app found: `{"mbps": 48.2, "app": "...", "deviceName": "..."}`
(`app` and `deviceName` as for signing in). tapiOca keeps it for the
**Access** tab, with where it ran as tapiOca sees it. It recommends
limits from the fastest recent tests.

| Field | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `mbps` | number | The speed kept, in megabits a second |
| `where` | string | `home`, or `away` (through the public port) |
| `eachMbps` | number | What one device watching takes, at the biggest picture the stations use |
| `room` | number | How many devices a connection this fast has room for at once |

## GET /api/internal/reach

Not for the apps. tapiOca asks this of itself, at the address set for
watching away from home, to check that apps can reach it from outside. The
result shows on the **Access** tab and in the page's header. It's open on
both ports, to anyone, over plain HTTP too, and before there's a user.
`?n=` is a random value a check is waiting for (for a minute at most). For
any other value, it answers 404 and nothing more.

| Field | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `stationplay` | boolean | Always true |
| `port` | string | The port the request came in on: `home`, or `public` |
| `https` | boolean | Whether the request came over HTTPS, as the reverse proxy in front reports (`X-Forwarded-Proto`) |

## POST /api/internal/report

From 1.22.1, when `features` lists `reports`: a problem report, for
whoever is looking into a problem. It shows what the app did recently, and
on what device. It goes in tapiOca's log, and so on the **Logs** tab, as
a warning that starts "Report from" and the app's name (with who's signed
in). Send:

```json
{"text": "...", "app": "tapiOca for Android TV", "deviceName": "Den"}
```

`text` is lines of plain text: the app's and device's details, then what it
did recently, oldest first, with any crash. Never include a token or a
password. tapiOca keeps at most 400 lines or 24,000 characters of it,
and notes how many it left out. Each address can send one report every 30
seconds, and another gets 429. An empty one gets 400.

| Field | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `ok` | boolean | Always true |

## POST /api/internal/problem

From 1.23.0, when `features` lists `problems`: a problem the app ran into,
sent by the app itself as it happens. It's kept for the **Logs** tab. There,
an Admin sees each problem with how often it happened, on how many devices
and on what kinds of device. So they can tell whether it affects one
device, one kind of device or everyone. Send what's known:

```json
{"kind": "station-stopped", "station": 5, "detail": "The picture stopped...",
 "app": "tapiOca for Roku", "version": "0.5.0",
 "device": "Roku Ultra 4850X, Roku OS 14.0", "deviceName": "Den",
 "at": 1791580000000, "journal": "Tuned to station 5\nThe picture stopped at 0:42"}
```

`kind` says when the app sends it:

- `station-failed`: a station didn't start (with `station`). Not when every
  tuner is in use or a limit was reached, since the person is told about
  those.
- `station-stopped`: a station stopped playing, and tuning in again didn't
  bring it back (`station`).
- `library-failed`: something from Media didn't play (`title`, as
  it's shown).
- `library-stopped`: playing from Media stopped and couldn't continue
  (`title`). With either of these two, from 1.30.0, send `session` (the
  playing's ID, from `POST /api/internal/play`) and `positionMs` (where in
  the program it happened). tapiOca checks that file at that point
  first, ahead of everything else it checks except a station's program
  about to air. It puts the file on the **Broken files** list only if it
  finds what's wrong. Without `session`, it checks what that device played
  last, where the app last reported it was, if the problem happened in the
  last 10 minutes (by `at`).
- `kept-up`: playing couldn't keep up, so a smaller version played
  (`title`, or `station`).
- `crashed`: the app closed unexpectedly last time (sent when it opens
  again; `detail` is the crash's first line).
- `unreachable` (from 1.29.1): the app couldn't reach tapiOca for a
  minute or more, sent once it's back. `detail` says what kind of trouble.
  It starts with one of "No network on this device", "tapiOca's address
  couldn't be found", "tapiOca didn't answer", "A secure connection
  couldn't be made" or "tapiOca answered with an error (503)" (apps from
  before 1.34.0 say "StationPlay" for "tapiOca": both are read). Then come
  the device's kind of network (Wi-Fi, mobile data, Ethernet; never its
  name or address) and how long it lasted. `lastedMs` says how long, in
  milliseconds. (Without it, tapiOca reads "for 3 min 20 s" or "for 1
  hr 5 min" from `detail`.) `at` is when it began. The **Logs** tab shows it
  as "Den couldn't reach tapiOca for 12 minutes · No network on this
  device."

`detail` is what the app saw, in a sentence (tapiOca keeps at most 300
characters). For a player's error, put its code first, as the player names
it: `ERROR_CODE_DECODING_FAILED` from Media3; `AVFoundationErrorDomain -11821`
or `NSURLErrorDomain -1009` from Apple's players, as "<domain> <code>";
`Roku error -5` from Roku's. Then add the rest of its message. The **Logs** tab
explains the codes it knows in plain words. `device` is the kind of device,
its model and its system, as a problem report's `Device:` line has it.
Never include a token, a password or a stream's private address.

From 1.29.1, also send:

- `at`: when it happened (milliseconds since 1970). An app keeps the
  problems it couldn't send (while tapiOca is out of reach, say) and
  sends them once it's back, oldest first. One from up to 7 days ago, or up
  to 5 minutes ahead (a device's clock a little off), is kept as happening
  then. Otherwise, it's kept as happening when it arrived. The **Logs** tab
  orders problems by when each happened.
- `journal`: the app's last lines before it, as a problem report has them,
  joined with `\n` (never a token, a password or a stream's private
  address). tapiOca keeps its newest lines, within 8 KB (8,192 bytes in
  UTF-8), for the **Logs** tab's **What led up to it**. A longer one is cut,
  leaving out its oldest lines.

The same problem from the same app and device within 10 minutes of the
first counts toward the first, and is written to tapiOca's log once.
Each app on each device can send at most 30 in 10 minutes, and more get 429
(keep them, and send them later). The 5,000 that happened most recently are
kept, so a backlog of old ones never pushes out newer ones. A `kind`
tapiOca doesn't know gets 400.

| Field | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `ok` | boolean | Always true |

## Reporting a problem

From 1.30.0, a person can report a problem with what they're watching. They
can report from a movie's or an episode's page, from the player's menu, and
from a station's player (about what's on it now). They pick the problem
from a list and never type it. The list comes from
`GET /api/internal/report-choices`, so it can change without an app update.
Show the choices under their `group` headings, in order, and send the one
picked with `POST /api/internal/report-problem`. Show the answer's `detail`
unchanged, and a refusal's `detail` unchanged too (the limits, or reporting
turned off).

tapiOca knows who sent a report, and on what device, from the app's
sign-in. What it does depends on the problem:

- **What tapiOca can check.** No picture, the picture breaking up, no
  sound, the sound cutting out, stopping early or not playing. tapiOca
  checks the file at once, around where the problem happened first.
- **What a machine can't judge.** This waits for an Admin on the **Broken
  files** tab.

A report alone never takes anything off the air, or out of Media. Offer
Report a problem only when `user.canReport` is true in
`GET /api/internal/me`. (An Admin can turn it off for someone, on the
**Access** tab.)

## GET /api/internal/report-choices

From 1.30.0: what a person can report, in order. Anyone signed in may ask
(or, while signing in is off, anyone at home).

| Field | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `choices` | list | The choices, in the order to show them |
| `choices[].id` | string | What to send as `choice` |
| `choices[].group` | string | The heading it's under: "Picture", "Sound", "Subtitles", "The program" or "Details" |
| `choices[].label` | string | What to show, such as "No sound" |

## POST /api/internal/report-problem

From 1.30.0: a person's report. For an episode or a movie (from its page,
or the player's menu), send its key:

```json
{"choice": "no-sound", "key": "1234", "positionMs": 754000,
 "method": "direct", "version": "5678", "audio": "1235", "subtitle": null}
```

For what's on a station now (from the station's player), send its number
instead. tapiOca knows the program, and where in it the station is.

```json
{"choice": "picture-breaks", "station": 5}
```

`choice` is a choice's `id`. Also send what the app knows: `positionMs`
(where in the program, if it's playing or was), and how it was playing.
That's `method` (as the play answer had it: `direct`, `repackage` or
`convert`), `version` (the version playing), and `audio` and `subtitle`
(the tracks' IDs; null for none). Leave out what you don't know. Without a
`version`, tapiOca uses what that device played of it recently, or else
its best version.

The answer is `{"detail": "Thanks. An Admin will take a look."}`: show it.
Each refusal has a `detail` to show unchanged:

- **400:** a `choice` that isn't one, both a key and a station or neither,
  or a show rather than an episode or a movie.
- **403:** "An Admin has turned off reporting problems for you."
- **404:** it isn't shared, this person can't see it, or there's no such
  station, or nothing on it.
- **429:** one report a day per person for each program ("You've reported
  this one today. Thanks."), and 10 a day per person ("That's all the
  reports for today. Thanks for your help.").

| Field | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `detail` | string | What to show: "Thanks. An Admin will take a look." |

## Admin alerts

From 1.29.0, tapiOca raises an alert for each problem an Admin can act
on, once when it starts and again when it's fixed:

- Plex can't be reached (or won't accept tapiOca's token).
- The data folder is nearly full or can't be written to.
- A station keeps failing to start.
- Backups are failing.
- The clock is badly off (by Plex's).
- The apps can't reach tapiOca from outside (the outside check).

An alert is raised only once the problem has lasted for some time, such as
3 checks in a row a minute apart, or a station failing to start 3 times in
10 minutes. It's marked fixed only once things have been right for some
time too, so no alert comes and goes. The **Logs** tab and the page's header
show alerts too, and an Admin can have them sent to up to 3 web addresses
(ntfy, Gotify, Home Assistant, Discord, Slack).

From 1.30.0, there's one more kind, `files`: something on the **Broken
files** tab needs an Admin. That's a person's report, a file a station or
Media plays that tapiOca found broken or damaged and that isn't being
replaced automatically, or one Sonarr or Radarr couldn't replace. For
example: "There are 3 files to look at on the Broken files tab: Tia
reported No sound on Northbound S2 E4." The alert shows how many, and the
newest, as more come. It's fixed when nothing there needs an Admin.

An Admin is told about files at most once an hour. Once an hour has passed
since the alert was last raised, anything new since then restarts it with a
new `id`, and the old one is no longer listed. (It isn't fixed, so don't
say it was.) The apps need nothing new for it: notify once for each `id`,
as for any alert. The web addresses get the same alerts.

For an Admin, an app shows the current alerts, with each `sentence`
unchanged and how long it's lasted, and can show when one is fixed. Ask
`GET /api/internal/alerts` when the app opens and comes back to the front,
and every few minutes while it's open. On Android, also ask every 15
minutes in the background (WorkManager), notifying once for each new `id`,
and once when it's fixed.

From 1.31.0, tapiOca keeps its alerts across a restart:

- **One still going** keeps its `id`. It isn't new, so don't notify again.
  But from 1.37.1, a station's alert is cleared when tapiOca is updated (or
  rolled back to an earlier version): it's listed as fixed, with its `id`,
  as what failed was another version's. If the station fails again, a new
  alert starts, with a new `id`.
- **One fixed while tapiOca was stopped** is listed as fixed, with its
  `id`, once its check finds it.
- **Those fixed in the last 24 hours** stay listed.

The apps need nothing new for it. Before 1.31.0 (and from 1.31.0, once a
backup is restored), the list starts fresh after a restart, and anything
still wrong starts again with a new `id`.

## GET /api/internal/alerts

For Admins only (from 1.29.0; while signing in is off, anyone at home).
Anyone else gets 403. Lists the current alerts, and those fixed in the last
24 hours. It's small and quick, to ask every few minutes.

| Field | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `alerts` | list | The alerts now, the newest first; then those fixed in the last 24 hours, the most recently fixed first |
| `alerts[].id` | string | Its ID: the same for as long as it lasts (one that starts again later has a new one) |
| `alerts[].kind` | string | What it's about: `plex`, `data-full`, `data-write`, `station`, `backups`, `clock`, `outside` or `files` (from 1.30.0; kinds may be added: show the sentence) |
| `alerts[].sentence` | string | What's wrong, in a sentence an Admin can act on, to show unchanged |
| `alerts[].since` | number | When it started |
| `alerts[].fixed` | number or null | When it was fixed; null while it lasts |

## Media

When an Admin shares Media folders with the apps (on the **Access** tab, under
**Media in tapiOca's apps**), the apps can browse them and play their
shows and movies whenever the viewer likes. Until then, `features` doesn't
list `library`, and these addresses answer 404 ("No Media folders are
shared with tapiOca's apps").

- **At home.** These addresses answer on the home network, or through a
  VPN, which looks like home.
- **Away from home, when it's on.** From 1.27.0, they answer through the
  public port too, while watching away from home is on (`features` lists
  `away`). There, a signed-in app can do whatever it may at home, and
  `features` lists `library` there too.
- **Away from home, when it's off.** Through the public port, these
  addresses answer 403, and `features` doesn't list `library` there.

To know which applies, ask `GET /api/v1/server` again where the app is (at
home, or away).

Anything that isn't in a shared Media folder answers 404, the same as something
that doesn't exist (and so does anything Plex says isn't there). Every one
of these answers within 8 seconds, however slow Plex is. When Plex is slow,
unreachable, or sends something tapiOca can't read, they answer 503
with "tapiOca can't reach Plex right now. Try again in a moment." (never
a 500). What tapiOca was fetching carries on meanwhile, so asking again
a little later often finds it ready.

From 1.29.1, nothing the apps receive names a file or a folder: not a play
answer, details, versions, tracks, alerts or refusals. A track whose title
in the file is a file's name ("Northbound.S02E04.1080p.mkv") is listed
without it. A program's own address ends in a plain name (`file.mkv`,
`index.m3u8`).

Keys are strings, and the same key always means the same show, movie or
episode. A Media folder may be Plex's (its keys are digits) or one of
tapiOca's own (its keys, and its shows', movies' and episodes', are `f`
and digits, from 1.35.0); the apps never need to tell them apart. Pictures (`poster`, `backdrop`, `thumb`) are addresses under
`/api/internal/art`. Add `&w=` with the width it will be shown at, in
pixels, and send the app's token with them.

tapiOca keeps each person's own place in what they watch: the Resume
row, where to resume and what they've watched. While signing in is off,
everyone shares one.

## Languages

From 1.29.0, each person has their own languages. tapiOca keeps them,
so they follow the person to every device. (While signing in is off,
everyone shares one set.)

- **Their own** (`languages` in `GET /api/internal/me`; set with
  `PUT /api/internal/languages`). The sound's language (null: each file's
  default track), subtitles Automatic, On or Off, and the subtitles'
  language.
- **For a show, or for an episode or a movie alone** (`languages` in
  `GET /api/internal/items/{key}`; set from the player with
  `PUT /api/internal/items/{key}/languages`, cleared with `DELETE`). Any of
  the three, each null where nothing is chosen there. A show's choice
  applies to all its episodes: that's the player's **Sticky Audio &
  Subtitles** (from 1.34.0; the reasons in `chosen` say "Sticky Audio" or
  "Sticky Subtitles"). An episode's applies to it alone.

Languages are ISO 639-2 codes, as files carry them (`eng`, `jpn`). For the
few with two codes, it's the one files use (`fre`, `ger`). Each comes with
a name to show ("English," "Japanese"). tapiOca knows the languages in
`choices` (in `GET /api/internal/me`). It also accepts two-letter codes
(`en`, `pt-BR`) and the other three-letter ones (`fra`, `deu`) for them.
Any other code is refused with 400 and a sentence to show.

When an app plays an episode or a movie (`POST /api/internal/play`) without
sending `audio` or `subtitle`, tapiOca chooses for whoever is signed
in. It takes each of the three from the most specific place it's chosen:
the episode's (or movie's), else its show's, else the person's own, else
the file's default.

- **Sound.** The first track in that language (the file's default among
  them first), never a commentary when there's another. With none in that
  language, the file's default.
- **Subtitles on.** A subtitle track in the subtitles' language, a full one
  before a forced one. (One for the deaf and hard of hearing counts as a
  full one.)
- **Subtitles off.** Only a forced track in the language of the sound that
  plays. (Forced subtitles cover the parts in another language, meant to
  be read.)
- **Subtitles Automatic** (from 1.34.0, where nothing turned them on or
  off, the person's own included). In the person's language when the sound
  is in another, as with them on; otherwise as with them off. Their
  language is their subtitles' language, else the device's (`language` in
  `POST /api/internal/play`); their sound's language never counts. When
  the sound's language isn't known, a full track in their language that
  the file has on (its default) shows. Automatic needs `language`: a play
  without it (from an app before 1.34.0) gets subtitles nobody turned on
  or off as off, exactly as before 1.34.0.

The answer's `chosen` shows what tapiOca chose, and why, in a few words
to show ("Japanese, kept for this show by Sticky Audio"; "English
subtitles, as the sound is Japanese"), and that's what plays. The
app selects `chosen.audio` and `chosen.subtitle` in its player. A subtitle
the player can't show itself is drawn into a copy's picture, as an app's
`subtitle` is, by the same rules. That's one whose format isn't in
`device.subtitles`, or, in a copy, one inside the file, since a copy holds
none.

An app that sends `audio` or `subtitle` (either, even null) gets exactly
that, as before, and `chosen` is null. So does someone who has chosen
nothing anywhere, when the app doesn't send the device's `language`: their
programs play as they did before 1.29.0. Stations
don't use these languages yet.

## Up next and the Resume row

tapiOca decides what's next in a show, the same for every app (a show's
`next`, and the Resume row). It works from this person's progress in the
show's episodes, newest first. Marking an episode not watched from a menu
says nothing about where they are, so those marks are passed over.

1. **An episode they're partway through**, or barely started (a special
   too): that one, where they stopped (from the start, if it was under a
   minute).
2. **After an episode they finished** (or marked watched): the first one
   after it that they haven't watched, in order across seasons (specials
   aside, and past any in the same file as it). With none, they've finished
   the show. Nothing is next (`next` is null, and it isn't on the Resume
   row), even if they skipped one before it.
3. **A special they finished** is passed over: they're where they were
   before it.
4. **Nothing yet:** the first episode (specials aside, unless the show has
   only specials). A show they haven't started isn't on the Resume row.

The Resume row has the movies they're partway through (a minute or more
in), and each show's Up next by rule 1 or 2. It's newest first, one per
show, up to 20. Only tapiOca keeps track of where they are (see
`POST /api/internal/progress`). What they watch in Plex's own players
doesn't count.

## GET /api/internal/libraries

The shared Media folders, in Plex's own order.

| Field | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `libraries` | list | The shared Media folders |
| `libraries[].key` | string | Its key |
| `libraries[].title` | string | Its name, such as "TV Shows" |
| `libraries[].kind` | string | `show` (a Media folder of shows) or `movie` |

## GET /api/internal/libraries/{key}

One shared Media folder's shows or movies, a page at a time: `?start=` (0 if it
isn't given) and `?size=` (1 to 200; 50 if it isn't given). Sorted by
`?sort=`:

- `title` (the default): by the sort title (or the title without
  a leading "The," "A" or "An"), from its first letter or digit. Case and
  accents are ignored ("Élan" with the Es), and numbers sort as numbers
  ("Lift Off 2" before "Lift Off 10"). Titles starting with a digit, or anything but
  A to Z (another alphabet, say), come first.
- `added`: newest first.
- `released`: newest first, with those without a date last.

Titles that sort alike (two movies called "Hamlet," or added at the same
moment) are always in the same order, so a page never repeats or skips one.
From 1.24.0, a list can be narrowed by `?genre=` (one of its `genres`) and
`?unwatched=1` (only movies this person hasn't watched, and shows with
episodes they haven't watched). A genre the Media folder has none of leaves
nothing.

| Field | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `key` | string | The Media folder's key |
| `title` | string | Its name |
| `kind` | string | `show` or `movie` |
| `total` | number | How many shows or movies it has in all, as narrowed |
| `start` | number | Where this page starts |
| `items` | list | This page |
| `items[]` | card | One show or movie |
| `genres` | list | The Media folder's genres, A to Z (from 1.24.0), to narrow it by |
| `genres[]` | string | One genre |
| `letters` | list | Sorted by `title`: where each letter starts in the whole list, as narrowed, for jumping to it: each letter once, in order, `#` first (`[]` for the other sorts; from 1.24.0). How many a letter has is where the next starts (or `total`), less its own `start` |
| `letters[].letter` | string | `A` to `Z`, or `#` for titles starting with a digit or anything else |
| `letters[].start` | number | Where its first show or movie is (a `start` to ask for) |
| `marks` | list | Where each group of the list, as sorted and narrowed, starts, in order, for the apps' dial; `[]` when there are none (from 1.37.0). Every sort has them: see [Marks](#marks) |
| `marks[].start` | number | Where the group's first show or movie is. The first is 0, and each is larger than the one before. How many a group has is where the next starts (or `total`), less its own `start` |
| `marks[].kind` | string | `letter`, `week`, `month`, `year`, `decade` or `undated`. An app that doesn't know a kind shows no dial for that list |
| `marks[].value` | string | For `letter`: `#` or `A` to `Z`. For `month`: `YYYY-MM`. For `year`: `YYYY`. For `decade`: its first year (`1980`). `""` for `week` and `undated` |

### Marks

What makes a group, for each sort (each group is in one piece, and no `kind` and `value` repeats):
- **`title`:** the letter each title is listed under, so exactly `letters`' groups.
- **`added`** (newest first): `week`, added in the 7 days before the request (or later than now); then `month`, the rest of this calendar year by month; then `year`, earlier years; then `undated`. Months and years are in the server's own time zone, as INFO's blocks and the guides' hours are.
- **`released`** (newest first): `decade`, from the year that starts its release date, or its year; then `undated`. A release date that doesn't start with a four-digit year in the digits 0 to 9 (an NFO's free text, say) sorts and counts as though it had no date: in its year's decade when it has a year, else undated, last (from 1.37.0; before, "Unknown" sorted first).

They're counted from the same list as `total` and `items`: after Viewing Levels, the genre and Unwatched, so a title someone can't see is never counted.

## GET /api/internal/home

What the app's home screen shows.

| Field | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `continue` | list | The Resume row: the movies this person is partway through, and each show's Up next (see Up next and the Resume row), newest first, one per show (up to 20) |
| `continue[]` | card | An episode or movie; `positionMs` is where to start it |
| `added` | list | Each shared Media folder's recently added shows or movies (Media folders with none are left out) |
| `added[].library` | string | The Media folder's key |
| `added[].title` | string | Its name |
| `added[].items` | list | Its newest movies, or the shows with the newest episodes (up to 20) |
| `added[].items[]` | card | One show or movie |

## GET /api/internal/search

Search is the only place Media and the stations meet. It finds shows
and movies whose titles contain `?q=`, across the shared Media folders, and the
stations airing a show or movie with it in its title right now. It answers
wherever the stations do, with `items` empty where Media isn't
offered.

- **Length.** `q` is 1 to 100 characters. A single letter is fine, for
  searching as the viewer types. An empty or longer `q` is refused (400,
  with the sentence to show).
- **Matching.** Case, accents and punctuation are ignored: "elodie" finds
  "Élodie," and "moon rider" and "moonrider" find "Moon-Rider." A title is
  found by its sort title too ("glass orchard" finds "The Glass Orchard"
  as a title that's just that).
- **Order.** It answers up to 50, the best first: a title that's just what
  was typed, then titles starting with it, then titles with a word starting
  with it, then the rest. Each group is in title order (as `sort=title`
  lists them).

| Field | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `items` | list | What was found in Media |
| `items[]` | card | One show or movie |
| `onNow` | list | The stations airing a match now, in number order |
| `onNow[].number` | number | The station's number |
| `onNow[].name` | string | Its name |
| `onNow[].now` | program | What's on it now |

## GET /api/internal/items/{key}/related

From 1.24.0: up to 12 other shows or movies like this one, from its own
Media folder (an episode's are its show's), for More like this. Those sharing
the most of its genres come first, then the nearest in years. Empty when it
has no genres.

| Field | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `items` | list | Others like it |
| `items[]` | card | One show or movie |

## GET /api/internal/items/{key}/shuffle

From 1.37.0. A show's episodes in a random order, for Shuffle on its page: **Shuffle all**, and **Shuffle unwatched** with `?unwatched=1`. The app plays them one after another, each as it would play from the page.

- **Only what this person may see,** as every address here: a show that isn't shared, or that's hidden from them, is answered as though it weren't there (404). A movie's or an episode's key is refused (400).
- **Specials aside,** and each file once: episodes in one file with others ("S01E01-E02") play it once.
- **Unwatched:** only the episodes this person hasn't watched. With none left, `items` is `[]`.
- **A new order each time,** at most 500 episodes.

| Field | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `show` | string | The show's key |
| `unwatched` | boolean | Whether only unwatched episodes were asked for |
| `total` | number | How many are in `items` |
| `items` | list | The episodes, in the order to play them |

## GET /api/internal/items/{key}/episodes

A show's episodes, in order: seasons in order, specials last, and episodes
without a season or a number after those with one (those alike always in
the same order). It lists all of them, or one season's with `?season=`.
From 1.30.0, it answers a page at a time, with `?start=` (0 if it isn't
given) and `?size=` (1 to 500; 500 if it isn't given). Ask for the next
page while `start` plus the episodes you have is less than `total`.

| Field | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `show` | string | The show's key |
| `season` | number or null | The season asked for (null: all of them) |
| `total` | number | How many episodes there are in all, of the season asked for (from 1.30.0) |
| `start` | number | Where this page starts (from 1.30.0) |
| `episodes` | list | Its episodes: this page |
| `episodes[]` | card | One episode |

## PUT /api/internal/items/{key}/languages

From 1.29.0, from the player's Audio & subtitles: sets languages for
whoever is signed in (see Languages). Send a show's key for the whole show,
or an episode's or a movie's key for it alone. Send what changes, each
optional:

```json
{"audio": "jpn", "captions": false, "captionLanguage": null}
```

Each language is a code, or null to clear that one (then the show's choice,
or the person's own, applies). `captions` is true, false or null. What
isn't sent stays unchanged. Answers 400, with the sentence to show, for a
language tapiOca doesn't know, or a key that isn't a show, an episode
or a movie (a season, say). Answers 404 for what isn't shared or can't be
seen, as its details do.

## DELETE /api/internal/items/{key}/languages

From 1.29.0, clears all three for a show, an episode or a movie, for
whoever is signed in. Their show's choice, or their own, then applies
again. Answers as `PUT` does, with `item` null.

| Field | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `item` | object or null | Null: nothing is chosen for it now |
| `show` | object or null | (An episode) what's chosen for its whole show, as in `PUT` |
| `show.audio` | object or null | As in `PUT` |
| `show.audio.code` | string | Its code |

## GET /api/internal/art/{key}

A picture, as JPEG or PNG (or WebP or GIF, as Plex has it, or as it's
kept beside a file in a Media folder of tapiOca's own):

- **Kind.** `?kind=poster` (the default; 2:3, and an episode's is its
  show's), `backdrop` (16:9) or `thumb` (an episode's still, 16:9).
- **Width.** `?w=` is the width in pixels (1 to 10000; 320 if it isn't given). It's
  rounded up to 160, 320, 480, 720, 1280 or 1920, with the largest for
  anything wider.

It answers 404 if there's no such picture, or what Plex has isn't one, and
answers at once when Plex says there's none. It answers 503 when
Plex doesn't send it in time, as for the rest of Media.

Each comes with `Cache-Control: private, max-age=86400` and an `ETag`. Keep
it a day. After that, ask again with `If-None-Match` and its ETag. While
it's the same, the answer is 304, with nothing in it. A picture's address
stays the same for as long as it's the same show, movie or episode, so apps
cache by it.

## POST /api/internal/play

Starts playing an episode or movie. Send its key and what the device can
play, as the device itself reports it (never a guess). Optionally send
`app` and `deviceName` (as for signing in, for the log):

```json
{"key": "1234",
 "device": {"containers": ["mkv", "mp4", "mov", "ts", "webm"],
            "video": [{"codec": "h264", "width": 3840, "height": 2160, "bitDepth": 8},
                      {"codec": "hevc", "width": 3840, "height": 2160, "bitDepth": 10}],
            "hdr": ["hdr10", "hlg"],
            "audio": ["aac", "ac3", "eac3", "mp3", "opus", "flac"],
            "subtitles": ["srt", "ass", "vtt", "pgs"]},
 "app": "tapiOca for Android TV", "deviceName": "Den"}
```

`hdr` lists only what the screen shows (`hdr10`, `hlg`, `dv` for Dolby
Vision), or `[]` for a screen without HDR. From 1.29.0, `subtitles` lists
the subtitle formats its player shows itself (`srt`, `ass`, `vtt`,
`mov_text`, `pgs`, `vobsub`), in a file it plays directly or alongside a
copy. A subtitle chosen for the person in another format is drawn in (see
Languages). Without the list, every subtitle chosen for them is drawn in.

Add `"version"` (a version's `id` from its details) to play that version.
Without it, the best version the device can play directly plays, unless the
app sends `"maxKbps"`. That's how much its connection to tapiOca
carries, as it measured recently (with `/api/internal/speed-test`). Then the
best version that connection keeps up with plays (one that needs no more
than two-thirds of it, on average). With none, the smallest the device can
play plays.

A file plays directly when the device can play its file type, its
picture's format at its size and bit depth, and its HDR. (Dolby Vision
profile 5 needs `dv`. Other profiles also play as the HDR10, HLG or
ordinary picture beneath.) The device must also play the sound of its
default track, or of `audio` if it's sent, or else of the one chosen for
the person (see Languages).

When it can't, tapiOca 1.24.0 and later makes a copy it can play
(`features` lists `convert`), for an app that says it takes one.
`device.hls` lists what its player takes in an HLS playlist: `ts` (MPEG-TS
pieces with H.264), `ts-hevc` (MPEG-TS pieces with HEVC) and `fmp4`
(fragmented MP4 pieces; not made yet).

- **Repackaged** (`repackage`): the picture unchanged, and its sound
  converted where the device needs it. This happens when the device plays
  the picture and the copy's pieces can carry it.
- **Converted** (`convert`): otherwise. The picture is made H.264, at most
  1080p, and ordinary rather than HDR.

With `device.hls`, a copy is also made when the app sends:

- `subtitle`: the ID of a subtitle track to draw into the picture. This is
  for a track the player can't show itself: picture subtitles on a player
  without them, and any track inside the file while a copy plays. The copy
  is converted.
- `fit: true` with `maxKbps`: a smaller picture made to fit the connection,
  when no version keeps up. The copy is converted.
- `night: true`: night mode's sound (as the stations' `nightHls`), for an
  app that can't make it itself.
- `language` (from 1.34.0): the device's own language setting, such as
  `en-US`, for Automatic subtitles, which apply only when it's sent (see
  Languages). One tapiOca doesn't know leaves your language unknown, so
  Automatic shows only the sound's forced subtitles.
- `convert: true` (from 1.29.1, when `features` lists `convert-asked`): a
  converted copy, whatever `device` says it plays. This is for when the
  device's decoder failed at the file (Media3's
  `ERROR_CODE_DECODING_FAILED`, say), so asking for the same again would
  only fail again.
  - The picture is made H.264 at 8 bits, at most 1080p (within 1920×1080,
    or the device's own H.264 size if that's smaller), and ordinary rather
    than HDR.
  - The sound is AAC: 5.1 where the file's has more than two audio
    channels and `device.audio` lists a surround format (`ac3`, `eac3`,
    `dts` or `truehd`), otherwise stereo.
  - Everything else asked for still applies: `startMs`, `version`, `audio`,
    `subtitle`, `night`, `fit` with `maxKbps`, and the cap away from home.
  - Its `why` starts with "a converted copy, as the app asked". It counts
    against the copies converted at once, as any converted copy does.
  - Send the problem the app ran into first (`POST /api/internal/problem`,
    kind `library-failed` or `library-stopped`, with the player's error in
    `detail`). tapiOca's log then shows that the app asked for the copy
    after that.
  - Without `device.hls` (`ts`), the answer is 422 with `detail`. A file
    that can't be converted (a Dolby Vision profile 5 picture, say) gets
    422 with `detail` and `why`, as below.

From 1.27.0, while `features` lists `even-sound` (an Admin's switch, on by
default), every episode (never a movie) plays at the stations' loudness, so
a show's episodes match. With `device.hls`:

- An episode the device plays directly comes as a `repackage` copy. Its
  picture is unchanged, and only its sound is remade. The sound is what the
  device would get anyway, but not copied, so sound sent unchanged to a
  receiver comes as 5.1 or stereo. Its `why` is
  `["even sound for the show's episodes"]`.
- Any other copy of an episode has even sound too, and says so in its
  `why`.
- Where the picture can't be kept unchanged, the episode plays directly
  (`direct`).

Show the copy's `why` in the player's info. Without `device.hls`, an
episode plays as it did before.

Send `startMs` too: where the player will start (by default, where this
person stopped). A copy's playlist says to start there, and tapiOca
starts making it there. `audio` (a sound track's ID) plays that track. A
copy holds only that one, so another track means another copy. Ask again
with it and `startMs` where the viewer is, and `POST` the old one's
`leave`.

If the device can't play the file directly and no copy can be made, the
answer is 422, with `detail` (a sentence to show) and `why` (a list of the
reasons). That happens when the app didn't send `device.hls`, or nothing it
takes would show the file correctly. tapiOca converts at most 3 copies
at once, or 6 on a GPU (repackaging costs next to nothing). One more gets
503 with `detail`. (A device's own copy, which a new one takes over from,
isn't counted.)

From 1.30.0, a version tapiOca found broken never plays
(`versions[].problem` is `broken`: its checks found it can't play). Another
version plays instead, if there's one tapiOca didn't find broken
(whichever would play otherwise, as above). `why` says so ("another
version, as 4K can't play right now"), whether it plays directly or as a
copy. With none, the answer is 422, with the `detail` "This one can't play
right now. An Admin has been told." (and `why`). A damaged version plays,
as before. Trouble playing a version isn't a verdict on its own. That's a
copy that can't be made, or a problem the app sends (see
`POST /api/internal/problem`). tapiOca checks the file at that point,
and only what it finds puts the file on the list.

Every refusal has `detail`, a sentence to show unchanged:

- **400:** an episode or a movie wasn't chosen, or the request wasn't
  understood.
- **404:** it isn't shared, can't be seen, or has no file.
- **422:** as above, or every version of it was found broken.
- **503:** Plex can't be reached, the file can't be read right now, a copy
  can't be started, too many are being converted, or one more device than
  the limits allow (with `limit` and `most`).

From 1.30.0, a device plays one program at a time. Asking for another, or
for the same one again (another sound track, a smaller version), ends the
one it was playing, and the copy being made for it, if any. Its addresses
answer 404 from then on. So ask for the next episode when it's time to play
it, not while another plays. A device is an app's sign-in (each app signs
in on its own), or, while signing in is off, its address.

From 1.31.0, a movie Plex has in several files (stacked: "Part 1" and "Part
2") plays as one program. (Before, its first file played.) Its `durationMs`
is the whole, it counts as watched at 90% of the whole, and resume,
progress, seeking and Up next use the whole, as for any program.

- **With `device.hls`,** it plays as a copy that joins its files, from
  `startMs` as usual. The copy is `repackage` (its picture unchanged) when
  every file's picture is the same and the device plays it, and `convert`
  otherwise. Its `why` starts with "its 2 files, played as one". The app
  needs nothing new: play it as any copy. Subtitles are drawn into the
  picture rather than listed with a `url`, since a separate subtitle file
  matches only one of the files.
- **Without `device.hls`,** it gets 422, with `why` ["it's in 2 files"] and
  `detail`, unless another version (in one file) plays directly.

Nothing names its files.

An Admin's limits on devices watching count programs played this way too
(see Playing a station in `docs/api.md`). Through the public port, the
limit on devices away from home applies as well. One more device gets 503
with `limit` and `most`.

From 1.27.0, away from home (through the public port), a program plays at
the quality an Admin chose for Media away from home: as it would at home,
or up to a number of Mbps. With a cap, the best version within it plays
(directly, or as a copy, as at home). With none within it, a copy is
converted down to fit, and `why` says so: "a smaller copy, within the 10
Mbps allowed away from home". Any copy converted there stays within the
cap. An app that doesn't send `device.hls` gets 422 for a program over the
cap, with `detail` and `why`. `maxKbps` and `fit` work on top of the cap,
as at home.

Skip intro and Skip credits are for episodes only. Show Skip intro while
the player is inside `markers.intro`, and Skip credits inside
`markers.credits`, again whenever the viewer goes back into them. Pressing
one moves to the end of that part, or with `creditsToEnd`, on to the next
episode. Offer the buttons, and skip without asking only where the viewer
has turned that on. Movies have no markers, since where a movie's credits
start is too often uncertain.

When playing keeps stopping to load, let the player's buffer deal with it
first. Only trouble that lasts counts. In the Android app, nothing in the
first 45 seconds counts but one 20-second stall. After that, it counts 4
stalls of a second or more within 3 minutes, 20 seconds of them in all, or
frames not drawn in time through most of a minute. Then short tests find
where the trouble is: a connection test (`/api/internal/speed-test`)
against `bitrateKbps`, and how fast the file itself has been arriving. If a
smaller version is `playable`, do as `whenSlow` says, from where the viewer
is. But switch automatically only when the tests showed where the trouble
is, and otherwise offer it. With none, say so plainly.

| Field | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `session` | string | This playing's ID (for progress reports) |
| `method` | string | How it plays: `direct` (the file unchanged), `repackage` or `convert` (a copy; from 1.24.0) |
| `url` | string | What the player plays (it needs no token): the file, such as `/play/<session>/file.mkv`, whose ranges are answered so the player can seek; or a copy's HLS playlist, `/play/<session>/index.m3u8`, listing the whole program from its start (a jump far ahead takes a few seconds more to start). Relative to where the app asked: a program started through the public port plays there (and at home), one started at home never plays through the public port. From 1.40.0, while it plays, its person's limits are checked again every 2 seconds, from what tapiOca knows (what it doesn't know yet is found out in the background and judged a moment later): one an Admin's change no longer allows ends, what it's sending is cut, and its addresses (the file, the copy's playlist and pieces, subtitles, a piece already being waited on included) answer 403 `{"detail": "This title is restricted.", "code": "restricted"}` (for as long as it's one of the last 200 plays to end); asking to play it again, or saying where it was, answers the same for 10 minutes. A play that ends for any other reason (its person removed or signed out, its device revoked, its Media folder no longer shared, watching away from home turned off) is cut too, and answers 404. An app shows the sentence, and doesn't start it again by itself |
| `why` | list or null | Why a copy is made (null for `direct`); and from 1.30.0, that another version plays, in place of one tapiOca found broken (for `direct` too) |

| `chosen.subtitleWhy` | string | Why: "English subtitles, as you chose", "Forced English subtitles, for the parts in another language", "Subtitles are off" (from 1.29.1; "captions" before) |
| `leave` | string | Where to `POST` when the player stops |
| `resumeMs` | number | Where playing starts again: 15 seconds before where this person stopped (from 1.36.3; exactly there before), never before the start (0: the start). Offer to resume there, or start over |
| `durationMs` | number or null | How long it is |
| `bitrateKbps` | number or null | What the file (or a converted copy) needs, in kilobits a second: to tell, when playing keeps stopping to load, whether the connection is too slow for it (see `/api/internal/speed-test`) |

| `subtitles[].url` | string or null | For a file of its own: where to get it, to add alongside the video (it needs no token). Tracks inside the file are the player's to show |

The `url` (and subtitles' `url`) stop working (404) when the app `POST`s to
`leave`, when the same device plays something else (from 1.30.0), after 4
hours unused, when the app's sign-in ends, when its Media folder is no longer
shared, when watching away from home is turned off (for one started through
the public port), and when tapiOca restarts. Choose the program again
to play it again. Through the public port, a sign-in that ends stops its
programs at once.

An app gone without its `leave` (closed, or out of reach) doesn't leave
anything being made for long. A copy stops being made 2 minutes after its
player last asked for a piece. The pieces made are deleted after 10
minutes, and made again, from where the player is, if it comes back.

## POST /api/internal/progress

Where this person is in an episode or movie. Send this every 10 seconds or
so while it plays (`session` keeps the device counted as watching), and
when it stops, before its `leave`:

```json
{"key": "1234", "positionMs": 1325000, "session": "...", "sequence": 12}
```

Or mark it from a menu: `{"key": "1234", "watched": true}` (or `false`).

- **`sequence`** (from 1.30.0): each report's number in its playing (1, 2,
  3...). A report numbered no higher than one tapiOca already has for
  that playing (sent before it, but arriving after) changes nothing. It's
  answered with what's kept, so a late report never moves someone back.
  (Rewinding is a newer report, so it does.) Without `sequence`, reports
  count as they arrive.
- **Bounds.** `positionMs` is a whole number of milliseconds, 0 to 7 days.
  Anything else is refused (400, with the sentence to show). A little past
  the end counts as the end. More than 10 minutes past the end of what
  plays is refused: "That's past the end of this program." (What plays is
  the version playing, with `session`. Without it, it's the longest
  version.)
- **Watched.** Into an episode's closing credits, or 90% of the way through
  what plays, whichever comes first. For a movie in several files, that's
  all of them (see `POST /api/internal/play`). It then starts from the
  beginning next time, and Up next moves on. Watched stays watched while
  it's watched again. Less than a minute in also starts from the beginning
  next time (see Up next and the Resume row).
- **Episodes in one file.** For an episode in one file with others
  ("S01E01-E02"), where it is, and whether it's watched, applies to the
  others too.
- **How often.** Every second is fine. With `session`, Plex isn't asked
  anything for a report (one is kept even while Plex is unreachable).
  Nothing is ever sent on to Plex. tapiOca keeps each person's place
  itself, and leaves Plex's own watched marks unchanged.

| Field | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `positionMs` | number | Where it will start next time |
| `watched` | boolean | Whether this person has watched it |

## POST /api/internal/watched

From 1.36.3. A whole show, or one of its seasons, marked watched or not
from a menu, in one request:

```json
{"show": "1234", "season": 2, "watched": true}
```

Leave out `season` (or send `null`) for the whole show; `0` is Specials.
Answered with `{"watched": true, "marked": 7}`, how many episodes it marked.

- **Only what this person may see,** as for every address here. A show
  that isn't shared, or that's hidden from them, is answered as though it
  weren't there (404). A movie's or an episode's key is refused (400): mark
  those with `POST /api/internal/progress`.
- **All or none.** Every episode is marked together, or none is. Each
  starts from the beginning next time, as when one is marked.
- **Episodes in one file** with one marked ("S01E01-E02") are marked with it.
- **At most 2,500 episodes** at once. More is refused (400): "That's too
  many episodes to mark at once. Mark one season at a time."
- **An older tapiOca** (before 1.36.3) doesn't have this address: mark each
  episode with `POST /api/internal/progress` there.
