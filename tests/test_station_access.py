"""Restricted Station access (1.39.0, the owner's D01, October 17): someone
with limits can tune in to a Station only while nothing it plays from now on
is above them. One shared broadcast for everyone; never a stand-in for one
viewer. A Station an Admin allowed for them by hand is blocked only while
something above them is in its published schedule (the next 48 hours, the
guides'), and comes back once that has aired (the owner, 12:58 PM: "The
station is blocked for kid while a restricted title is scheduled. Once the
title passes, then kid is allowed to resume watching the station").

What's checked: a title on now or coming up blocks; an episode rated above
its show; someone already watching is stopped when that changes, and
everyone else watches on; nothing of a blocked Station reaches its guide;
and a schedule that can't be read keeps it blocked."""
