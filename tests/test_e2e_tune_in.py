"""End to end: tuning in from the beginning (a station's tune_in "start"),
with real ffmpeg and the test episodes of test_e2e_skipping (solid-colour
stretches, so what aired can be read back frame by frame).

Episode 1: a cold open (yellow 6s), the intro (skipped), the program (cyan
10s), the credits (skipped). Episode 2: straight into the intro (skipped),
then the program (orange 10s). Every episode's sound is a 440 Hz tone.
