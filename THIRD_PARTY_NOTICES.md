# Open-source notices

tapiOca is built on the open-source work of others. This file lists the
parts in tapiOca's Docker image that come from others, and their
licenses. Each part keeps its own license.

## tapiOca

Copyright © 2026 egadgetboy. tapiOca is licensed under the GNU Affero
General Public License, version 3 (AGPL-3.0). See the [LICENSE](LICENSE)
file. Its source is at <https://github.com/egadgetboy/tapioca-server>.

Everything in the image that isn't listed below is tapiOca's own,
under the AGPL.

## Where to find the exact versions

The image records every Debian package installed in it, with its exact
version and the source package it's built from, in
`/opt/stationplay/third-party-packages.txt` (one line each, such as
`libavcodec61 <version> (source: ffmpeg <version>)`). Each Debian
package's own copyright and license notice is in the image at
`/usr/share/doc/<package>/copyright`.

To get the source of a Debian package at the exact version installed, use
the source package and version in that file:

- <https://sources.debian.org/src/ffmpeg/> (choose the version), or
- <https://snapshot.debian.org/package/ffmpeg/> (choose the version), or
- `apt-get source ffmpeg=<version>` on a Debian system with source
  packages turned on.

The same works for every package in the list: replace `ffmpeg` with its
source package.

## FFmpeg

- **What:** Debian's `ffmpeg` package (the `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` programs)
  and the FFmpeg libraries it installs (`libavcodec`, `libavformat`,
  `libavfilter`, `libavutil`, `libswscale`, `libswresample` and others).
  tapiOca runs these programs to do all its video work. It doesn't
  change them.
- **License:** Most of FFmpeg's code is under the GNU Lesser General Public
  License, version 2.1 or later (LGPL-2.1-or-later). Debian builds FFmpeg
  with its GPL parts turned on, so FFmpeg as installed in the image is
  under the GNU General Public License, version 2 or later
  (GPL-2.0-or-later). Some files carry other licenses, all listed in
  `/usr/share/doc/ffmpeg/copyright`. In the running container,
  `ffmpeg -L` prints the license of the build.
- **Libraries FFmpeg uses:** Debian installs the libraries FFmpeg needs
  (for example x264, x265, libvpx, dav1d and opus). Each is under its own
  license, in its own `/usr/share/doc/<package>/copyright`, and listed in
  `third-party-packages.txt`.
- **Source:** Debian's `ffmpeg` source package, at the version listed in
  `third-party-packages.txt` (see above). From 1.34.0, tapiOca's
  image is published (`ghcr.io/egadgetboy/tapioca-server`), and each release
  carries `tapioca-<version>-source.tar`: the source of every GPL and
  LGPL package in its images, FFmpeg's among them, at the exact versions
  in them, as Debian publishes it. Each release also comes with
  `tapioca-<version>-packages.txt` (and `-packages-arm64.txt`), the
  packages in each image, each with a link to its source. An image you
  build yourself gets Debian's packages from Debian on the day it's built,
  and `third-party-packages.txt` in it lists them. FFmpeg's upstream
  project is at <https://ffmpeg.org>.

## Fonts

- **DejaVu fonts** (Debian's `fonts-dejavu-core`), used to draw the
  "We'll be right back" card and station number badges. Copyright © 2003
  Bitstream, Inc. (Bitstream Vera); DejaVu's changes are in the public
  domain. License: the Bitstream Vera Fonts license, in
  `/usr/share/doc/fonts-dejavu-core/copyright`.
- **Montserrat** (in `app/assets/fonts/`), used to draw the Intro Bumper,
  Station ID card and corner clock. Copyright 2024 The Montserrat.Git
  Project Authors (<https://github.com/JulietaUla/Montserrat>). License:
  SIL Open Font License, version 1.1, in `app/assets/fonts/OFL.txt`.
- **Space Grotesk** (Medium) and **Unbounded** (Regular), in
  `app/assets/fonts/SpaceGrotesk/` and `app/assets/fonts/Unbounded/`,
  used to draw the INFO station's time, date and panels. Each is a single
  weight taken from the page's copy of the font (below), unchanged
  otherwise, under the same copyright and the same license: the SIL Open
  Font License, version 1.1, in the `OFL.txt` beside it.

- **Space Grotesk** (in `app/web/fonts/SpaceGrotesk/`), the page's text.
  Copyright 2020 The Space Grotesk Project Authors
  (<https://github.com/floriankarsten/space-grotesk>). License: SIL Open
  Font License, version 1.1, in `app/web/fonts/SpaceGrotesk/OFL.txt`.
- **Space Mono** (in `app/web/fonts/SpaceMono/`), the page's Station
  numbers, times and logs. Copyright 2016 The Space Mono Project Authors
  (<https://github.com/googlefonts/spacemono>). License: SIL Open Font
  License, version 1.1, in `app/web/fonts/SpaceMono/OFL.txt`.
- **Unbounded** (in `app/web/fonts/Unbounded/`), the page's big numbers;
  tapiOca's logo is drawn from it, as outlines. Copyright 2022 The
  Unbounded Project Authors (<https://github.com/googlefonts/unbounded>).
  License: SIL Open Font License, version 1.1, in
  `app/web/fonts/Unbounded/OFL.txt`.

The page's three fonts come with tapiOca and are served by it: the page
never fetches a font from anywhere else.

## Common passwords

`app/assets/passwords/common.txt` (from 1.36.2) holds the passwords of 8
characters or more (12 in 1.36.2 and 1.36.3) from the UK National Cyber Security Centre's list of the
100,000 most used passwords (drawn from Have I Been Pwned), lowercased, as
SecLists keeps it
(<https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists>, `Passwords/Common-Credentials/100k-most-used-passwords-NCSC.txt`).
SecLists is under the MIT License, Copyright (c) 2018 Daniel Miessler.
tapiOca only checks new passwords against it, on the server.

## Video drivers

These are installed so tapiOca can use a GPU. They're optional: if one
can't be installed, the image still builds.

- **Mesa VA-API drivers** (Debian's `mesa-va-drivers`), for AMD GPUs.
  Mostly under the MIT license, with some parts under other licenses. See
  `/usr/share/doc/mesa-va-drivers/copyright`.
- **vainfo** (Debian's `vainfo`, from libva-utils), for troubleshooting.
  MIT license. See `/usr/share/doc/vainfo/copyright`.
- **Intel Media Driver** (Debian's `intel-media-va-driver-non-free`, on
  x86-64 only), for Intel GPUs. Its source is under the MIT and BSD-3-Clause
  licenses. Debian places it in its "non-free" section because it includes
  some parts that come without source code. See
  `/usr/share/doc/intel-media-va-driver-non-free/copyright` for its terms.
- **The libraries they need** (such as libva, libdrm and LLVM) are each
  under their own license, in their own `/usr/share/doc/<package>/copyright`.

## Debian and Python

- **Debian GNU/Linux 13 (trixie)**, the base of the image
  (`python:3.13-slim-trixie`). Each package is under its own license, in
  `/usr/share/doc/<package>/copyright`.
- **Python 3.13**, from the official Python image. License: Python
  Software Foundation License, version 2 (PSF-2.0). See
  `/usr/local/lib/python3.13/LICENSE.txt` in the image, or
  <https://docs.python.org/3/license.html>.
- **pip**, installed with Python. MIT license.

## Python packages

Installed from `requirements.txt` at these exact versions. Each package's
license file is in the image, in its `.dist-info` folder under
`/usr/local/lib/python3.13/site-packages/`.

<https://github.com/certifi/python-certifi>, and the copy in the image is
unchanged.
