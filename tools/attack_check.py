"""Attack test for tapiOca's server, to run before a release.

It starts tapiOca on two free ports of its own (a home-network port and
a public one, as a reverse proxy reaches), against the stand-in Plex the
tests use, with an Admin, a User, a Kid on a limited Viewing Level, a
station, a shared library, an app signed in and a linked device. Then, from
the public port as an outsider (no sign-in), as a User, and as a Kid, it
tries what an attacker would and prints PASS or FAIL for each: routes
without and with the wrong role; forged headers; CSRF from another site;
path traversal; oversized bodies; script in names; guessing or reusing keys,
play addresses and reach nonces; reaching Media and stations a level hides;
the sign-in, PIN and link-code limits; who a linked device lists (new
people only on devices they sign in on, and Use for everyone: only for an
Admin, from tapiOca's own page, only its two choices, never moving who
can't sign in by name) and lists away from home; setting a PIN or
changing a password from the apps (as an
outsider, as someone else, an Admin's PIN, its format, the limits);
Admin alerts and the web address they're sent to (only for Admins; only
http and https, no redirects followed, never waited on); each person's
languages (their own only, and only languages tapiOca knows); Media's
addresses (every one refusing what a Kid's level hides, the same way, and
taking only what's bounded); a movie in several files played as one
(never what a level hides, its files never named, within its whole
length); people's reports (never from an outsider, always the sender's
own, within their level and the limits, the choices only the server's,
and only an Admin sees and acts on them); the Broken
files list as Media has it (trouble checked only from one's own playing,
and only for a problem just now; a broken file a level hides answered as
any hidden one; people's reports never crowded out of the checks' queue;
Retry and the tab's choices taking only what they should; Plex or Radarr
away said plainly, changing nothing); converted
copies on request (never of what a level hides, within the limit however
many ask at once); no file names in anything the apps receive; problems
sent later with their journals (only an Admin reads one, kept as text and
bounded, a backlog within the limits); the copies of the database
made before an update (never downloadable); Admin alerts kept across
restarts (whatever a sentence holds, kept and given back as it was; never
brought back by a backup, a forged one included; never stopped by a
database that can't be written; only so many fixed ones kept however many
come) and the corner mark's drift (only numbers, drawing whatever the
clock says); a file whose name and tags read like ffmpeg's own words
(where the deep scan finds damage stays where it is); and Media folders of
tapiOca's own (only an Admin adds one, only from inside the media folder;
browsing never leaves it; a video, poster or folder linked from outside it
is never read or served; the apps never get a file's name or a path); and
from 1.36.0, the doors left open (the home port forwarded, a proxy pointed
at it, headers from a device that isn't a trusted proxy, an internet name,
Docker hiding addresses: each treated as the internet, or not trusted, with
alerts that never give an address) and trusted networks (what can't be
listed, what's never trusted, a sign-in a network gives working only there,
the PIN limits, Tuner access by network). The public port's requests come
from a reverse proxy at home, listed as a trusted proxy (see AsPeer).

It's a tool, not part of CI (the test suite covers these as unit tests). Run
it from the repo root:  python -m tools.attack_check   (add -v to see every
check, not only failures).

It only ever talks to the tapiOca it starts here on localhost. It never
contacts any real server.
