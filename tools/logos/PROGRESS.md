# Logo library 1.8: progress

## 1.32 legal-care review (2026-10-11)
- Every logo checked against real US and UK networks' marks and real
  programs' names. 49 pictures redrawn (catalog version 4); 18 renamed,
  each keeping its id (`old_id=` in `net()`, or a genre variant's third
  item), so stations keep their logos. No logo was removed.
- Categories: "Movie channels" is now "Movie stations", "Over-the-air
  classics" is "Classic stations". No logo name says "channel".
- Number and letter badges have no shield (a number in a shield looks like
  a local station's); a scalloped rosette took its place.
- Rules for new logos: no eye in an almond, no fan or row of rainbow
  colors, no lowercase word in a circle, no ringed planet with "sci-fi",
  no real program titles (old local movie slots, horror-host shows, 1950s
  series), no "channel" drawn.
- `@fontsource/sacramento` was missing from package.json (Be Mine uses
  it); added at 5.3.0. A full rebuild reproduces every other PNG byte for
  byte.

## RESUME HERE (2026-10-01)
- All 495 new logos are drawn and committed, plus the shared "Collection"
  logo (tv_shows.py, category "On the air", id "collection": what stations
  made from Plex collections start with; never handed out at random).
- Last logo stage: seasons.py batch 4, Halloween (10) and Valentine's (7):
  Belfry bats lightened, Hayride straw tidied, Cupid's Arrow redrawn with
  the arrow between the words, Be Mine bricks clipped to the panel.
- Next: the 1.8.0 finish: integrate modules in build.py (ORDER/categories:
  "Classic TV", "TV shows", "Decades", "Over-the-air classics",
  "Cartoons & anime", "Teens", "Kids & family", "Movie channels",
  "Holidays & seasons"); remove Hanukkah + 18 sister channels with REPLACED
  mappings; build the library; update tests (catalog size).
- Lessons: never fit() inside a clipped <g> (measurement fails — draw then
  clip, or use mix-blend); no backslashes inside f-string expressions
  (Python 3.11); check new looks against existing logos for lookalikes.

Work in stages: one batch (~20 logos) per stage, committed when done.
Review each batch with `python3 review.py OUT MODULE FILTER`; fix, then commit.

## Decisions (agreed 2026-09-30)
- ~500 new standalone stations (no sister channels), names generic enough to
  reuse; spoof channel styles, never real names/symbols. Quality = current set.
- Remove Hanukkah (stations using it move to a winter logo).
- Remove the 18 old sister-channel logos (Velvet Rope Comedy/Family/Signature,
  Night Reel Action/Thriller/Sci-Fi, Premiere Row Family/Extreme, Gold Seal
  Comedy/Edge/Kids & Family, Second Showing Westerns/Classic/Action/Suspense/
  Family, Widescreen Hits, Vertical Hold Plus); stations using one move to its
  parent (REPLACED in build.py) — at the integration stage. (agreed 19:44)
- New logos are ADDED (library 507 -> ~1,000); retiring weak existing ones is
  fine, always with a REPLACED mapping so stations keep working.
- Style rule (19:41): real-network polish first — confident wordmarks,
  emblems, badges, screens. Humour comes from the name, not novelty props.
  Avoid cartoon gags (gloves, beanies, cans, boxes, smoke clouds...).
- Halloween and Valentine's get new sets; keep New Year's, Easter, Summer,
  Winter, Thanksgiving, Christmas with variety.
- Ship as 1.8.0 together with the Intro Bumper and corner clock (already
  committed), after all logos + full test run.
