"""Upgrade check, to run for every release: the release before it, then this
one on its data folder, then back again, and a fresh install.

1. The release before (by its git tag: the newest release tag older than
   this checkout's version, unless --from says: a tag, or a release's
   commit, its version as its app/__init__.py has it) is unpacked into a
   temporary folder with git archive, so the repository is left as it is.
2. It's started on a new data folder, against the tests' stand-in Plex
   served on a port of its own, and given data through its API: an Admin
   signed in on the page, a User with a PIN and a Viewing Level, a
   "Kids" User with neither a password nor a PIN, an app signed in on
   a linked device, settings, a station, and a problem from the app.
3. It's stopped, and this checkout is started on the same data folder,
   which must find everything there: everyone still signed in (the page and
   the app), the User's PIN and level, where everyone shows on the
   apps' pickers, the linked device, the settings and the station; and, if
   this version changes the database, the database backed up first, as
   before-<this version>-<date>.db, as the Logs tab says (otherwise no
   copy). What's new works with them: a problem with its journal, (from
   1.30.0) a person's report on the Broken files tab, with everyone able to
   report to start with, and (from 1.31.0) new people showing only on
   devices they sign in on, as the Admin never chose otherwise, and Use for
   everyone, which keeps Kids as they were; and (from 1.35.0) a Media
   folder of tapiOca's own, shared with the apps, and a station of it,
   which the release before, started on this database as it is, keeps.
4. Live alerts, kept across a restart (from 1.31.0): with Notify a web
   address on (to a stand-in here), the report becomes an alert, and
   backups failing another. The report is dismissed and tapiOca
   stopped before its next look, and started again: both alerts are there
   at once with the same IDs, neither is sent again, and the one fixed
   while it was stopped is said to be, once, at its first look; the other
   stays live.
5. It's stopped, and rolled back: first the release before is started on
   the database as it is, live alert and all (which it ignores, leaving the
   alerts as they were); then as the README's Rolling back says (the copy,
   if there is one, put back as stationplay.db, its -wal and -shm removed);
   the release before is started again, and must work with its data,
   signed in as before (or with what this version wrote, when there was no
   copy to put back), and with the broken-files list as this one left it:
   a program's entry as before, an entry for another of its versions (which
   a release before 1.30.0 doesn't know, and leaves alone; one from 1.30.0
   lists it too), and (from 1.31.0) one about the second of a movie's two
   files, listed as it is. There, the Admin chooses where new people show
   (Devices at home); this checkout is started again, and keeps that
   choice.
6. A fresh install of this checkout: it starts, takes its first Admin, and
   makes no copy; new people show only on devices they sign in on.

From 1.36.0: updated with signing in on, nothing is trusted and the setup
asks Who can use tapiOca again; a trusted network, a name for home and
Tuner access by network are listed, which the release before ignores (any
device at home uses the tuner there, as the notes say) and an update brings
back; and an install with signing in off keeps working at home, answers a
name that isn't home's with only its page, asks that one setup question
again, and alerts an Admin.

From 1.34.0: this checkout's update check never reaches GitHub here (a
stand-in answers, and notes each time it's asked), and must ask nothing
at all, as no Admin answers whether it may; the first start after the
update says so in the log; and the release before reads the alert settings
this version writes, a Slack first address and all (3, 4).

It prints PASS or FAIL for each check (failures always; all with -v) and
exits 1 if any failed. Each tapiOca it starts is on free ports of its
own, in a process group of its own, and only that group is stopped (by its
PID); nothing else is touched. Its temporary folders are deleted after
(--keep leaves them, with each tapiOca's output, for a look).

Run it from the repo root, with the tests' requirements installed:

    python tools/upgrade_check.py                  # the release before, to this checkout
    python tools/upgrade_check.py --from v1.28.1   # from another release
    python tools/upgrade_check.py -v --keep
